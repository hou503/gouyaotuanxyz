        <p>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/12/Looking back on Zhou Qi's NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I/08609f94d5364d1b88c57e0d4bb8242c.jpg" alt="Looking back on Zhou Qi&#39;s NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I"><br>​<br>Zhou Qi was officially laid off by the Rockets on December 18, 2018, at the end of last year. Since then, he has not given up his efforts to return to the NBA. He even once sought the chance to play in Europe. But in the end, Zhou Qi still returned to CBA and Guanghui Club in Xinjiang.<br>Yesterday, the Xinjiang men’s basketball team official announced that the team and Zhou Qi have completed the new contract signing, and will officially submit registration materials to the CBA league. After verification and public approval, Zhou Qi will play as a player of the Xinjiang team in the CBA of the new season.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/12/Looking back on Zhou Qi's NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I/a68d19fd30784a75a720459df5c660fe.jpg" alt="Looking back on Zhou Qi&#39;s NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I"><br>​<br>“When Zhou Qi decided to return to China to continue his basketball career, our club and Zhou Qi had many communications and exchanges on the details of signing the contract. Our Club fully affirms Zhou Qi’s promotion and progress after training in the NBA, and expresses its high sincerity on the premise of abiding by the requirements of the CBA League contract system. Zhou Qi has a rigorous and serious demand for personal career planning, and also expresses his strong feelings for his mother team. Ultimately, the two sides completed the signing in recent days, Zhou Qi officially returned to Guanghui Club as a big family. This is what the Xinjiang men’s basketball official announced.<br>Official propaganda content naturally refers to Zhou Qi’s NBA career. In fact, when Zhou Qi went to the United States to pursue the basketball dream, Xinjiang Team also opened the door to great convenience. After all, the Chinese team is not able to have the ability to attack the NBA, which is also the luck of Chinese basketball. In the past two years, Zhou Qi’s NBA trip is not so smooth, and Or there are other reasons, but ultimately, Zhou Qi chose to leave.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/12/Looking back on Zhou Qi's NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I/73d7998ad7e54e14a00432c11522f5ff.jpg" alt="Looking back on Zhou Qi&#39;s NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I"><br>​<br>At the end of last year, many fans may be surprised when they were laid off, but it seems understandable from Zhou Qi’s repeated demotion to the Rockets and his own performance on the pitch.<br>In his two-year NBA career, Zhou Qi spent most of his time with the Ogrand Valley Serpent Team, which belongs to the Rockets. After all, as a second-round show, the team’s expectations for him were not so great, and the Chinese market behind Zhou Qi has always been the focus of the Rockets.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/12/Looking back on Zhou Qi's NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I/bb85f87b917446f18c5624b7dc8887ad.jpg" alt="Looking back on Zhou Qi&#39;s NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I"><br>​<br>Zhou Qi played only 19 regular-season games in the NBA in two years. Of course, the Rockets had a good winning rate when Zhou Qi played in these two years, with 14 wins and 5 losses, and the winning rate was close to 74%, but Zhou Qi’s personal data can only be said to be general.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/12/Looking back on Zhou Qi's NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I/55d868c3e3d945aabfb212e02dc28538.jpg" alt="Looking back on Zhou Qi&#39;s NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I"><br>​<br>In 19 games, Zhou Qi averaged only 1.3 points, 1.2 rebounds and 0.7 blocked shots per game. The shooting percentage was 21.2%, the three-point shooting rate was 10.5%, and the free throw shooting rate was 66.7%, which were far below the average level of NBA.<br>In the 17-18 season, Zhou Qi’s salary was 820,000 US dollars. In the 18-19 season, Zhou Qi’s salary was 510,000 US dollars. In the two years of NBA career, Zhou Qi’s total salary was 132,000 US dollars without duplicate salary, which translated into RMB, and more than 9.29 million RMB.<br>Zhou Qi even played three games in the playoffs, the first round of the 17-18 season against Timberwolves, but only 2 points and 1 rebounds were scored in three games.<br>In fact, Zhou Qi did not play well in the NBA. On November 22, 2017, when the Rockets were playing at home against the Nuggets, the Rockets established their advantage early and eventually won by 30 points. In this game, Zhou Qi also appeared early and performed well.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/12/Looking back on Zhou Qi's NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I/770005a6f89941ed895d4f3b5d628733.jpg" alt="Looking back on Zhou Qi&#39;s NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I"><br>​<br>Zhou Qi played 12 minutes in the game. He made 2 of 6 shots and 2 of 3 of 4 shots. He finally got 6 points, 2 baskets, 1 assists and 1 blocked shot. The 3 points in 4-2 are enough to surprise people, and Zhou Qi’s frontal cap against Wilson Chandler on the defensive side fanned the ball out of the line directly, which made the fans on the spot exclaim.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/12/Looking back on Zhou Qi's NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I/6a34715546f64fdebd68719de9a8b83f.jpg" alt="Looking back on Zhou Qi&#39;s NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I"><br>​<br>Zhou Qi’s two-year NBA career is also over. Whether Zhou Qi will continue to attack the NBA in the future, and this year only 23-year-old Zhou Qi naturally still has a lot of hope. We naturally hope that Zhou Qi will one day stand on the stage of the NBA with a stronger posture and blossom a better self.</p>
