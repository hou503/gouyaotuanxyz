<h1 id="The-Jazz-of-the-small-lineup-have-the-power-to-fight-against-the-Rockets"><a href="#The-Jazz-of-the-small-lineup-have-the-power-to-fight-against-the-Rockets" class="headerlink" title="The Jazz of the small lineup have the power to fight against the Rockets"></a>The Jazz of the small lineup have the power to fight against the Rockets</h1><p>It wasn’t just this game, last game, when Claude started, the Jazz seemed to be able to break their wrists with the Rockets. Today, the Jedi survived, and the Jazz won the away victory.<br>In both matches, the Jazz took the initiative to change the lineup to a smaller size, which could increase the mobility of the lineup and add an extra threat from the outside.<br>And the Jazz just put one Gerber on the court, and their inside advantage is enough. Gobel and Feivos take turns to ensure that the line-up continues to be high enough.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/27/Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D'Antoni's strategy was wrong/197ada384577439cab545007d1f31107.jpg" alt="Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D&#39;Antoni&#39;s strategy was wrong"><br>​<br>Claude, who won the trust in the last game, did not disappoint. If the emotional player starts well, his threat will run through the game.<br>Claude’s performance in the previous two games was not so good. Today, in the first quarter, he broke through by three points and fired up completely. In the first quarter, he scored 14 points, which exceeded the total score in the previous two games.<br>Claude’s outbreak was also justified. Jazz’s performance outside the three-point line in this series is not good. Their adjustment in this series is to pass the ball more patiently and find the best chance to try another three-point.<br>The ball-holder uses more blocking and disassembling to kill the inside line, or uses Extra Pass to mobilize more rocket defense on the outside line, and finally finds an excellent opportunity.<br>Claude’s three points and lay-up in the first quarter are excellent opportunities for this kind of Extra Pass to export, and Claude also grasped them better. So the Jazz took a good lead.<br>The Jazz’s defense has also obviously improved.<br>Harden’s feel is still hot, but at least the Jazz’s breakthrough against Harden was the best one in the game. In particular, Gobel’s top defense and the other players’underhand pulls interfere with passing, or follow-up blockade to block Capella.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/27/Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D'Antoni's strategy was wrong/316b53dfc3bb46bbbb77fbd6aca90498.jpg" alt="Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D&#39;Antoni&#39;s strategy was wrong"><br>​<br>In addition, the Jazz’s first success in this game should be Mitchell, who broke out in desperation.<br>His outbreak at the beginning of the fourth quarter helped the team reverse the decline of the third quarter. Together with the home momentum and the rocket’s failure, the victory was firmly in the bag.<br>But the hero behind the game is Coach Schneider. Several of his decisions in this game are quite sensible.<br>For example, after half-time Ingers did not work well, the Jazz basically abandoned Ingers in the second half.<br>O’Neill has been playing a more defensive role in restricting Harden, and his breakthroughs and three points at the offensive end are also quite threatening.<br>And in the middle of the most anxious fourth quarter, the Rockets did not choose Capella, and Schneider did suddenly replace Gobel in the remaining four minutes of the game.<br>After Fervus replaced him, three consecutive rounds of front rebounds in the period of 3 minutes to 2 minutes, and two consecutive rounds of follow-up after Mitchell’s lay-up dunks, were regarded as completely killing the suspense of the game.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/27/Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D'Antoni's strategy was wrong/d262194ee890485f98544e35aaf13620.jpg" alt="Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D&#39;Antoni&#39;s strategy was wrong"><br>​<br>The Jazz had a huge rebound advantage in this game. The Rockets’small team even used Harden to play five main defenses against Gobel. In this case, the Jazz rebounded more than 17 Rockets throughout the game.<br>A famous Japanese center, Akira Gangxian, once said, “The person who controls the rebound can control the game.”<br>And this game, Mitchell’s fourth quarter start is the momentum, killing the game, it is the Rockets can not grab the front rebound and can not hold back the backcourt rebound.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/27/Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D'Antoni's strategy was wrong/e285fb2c2be7407bb2dbfcce32408ad3.jpg" alt="Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D&#39;Antoni&#39;s strategy was wrong"><br>​</p>
<h1 id="The-Rockets-suddenly-missed-three-points-and-Paul-was-unwilling"><a href="#The-Rockets-suddenly-missed-three-points-and-Paul-was-unwilling" class="headerlink" title="The Rockets suddenly missed three points and Paul was unwilling."></a>The Rockets suddenly missed three points and Paul was unwilling.</h1><p>Rockets today’s three points can not be said, a total of 46 shots 17, the shooting rate is close to 37%. At one point in half time, the rocket had a 50% hit rate.<br>In this game, Tucker and Gordon felt quite hot outside the three-point line, but in the crucial fourth quarter, the Rockets’three-point power was suddenly cut off. The blackout was inexplicable and fatal.<br>From the end of the third quarter to the beginning of the fourth quarter, the Rockets lost 12 consecutive points, which seems to be returning to the dead cycle of last season’s Western Finals G7.<br>The Jazz’s outburst disrupted the Rockets’rhythm, and then the Rockets were eager to chase points, forcing the shot to miss three points.<br>The Jazz chased back and scored again. The Rockets threw a three-point miss again. After several consecutive rounds, the game was over.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/27/Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D'Antoni's strategy was wrong/4a8b5e87e2954283993a8aef76e80b87.jpg" alt="Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D&#39;Antoni&#39;s strategy was wrong"><br>​<br>Of course, throughout the fourth quarter, Paul, the only rocket, remained awake.<br>Paul’s fourth quarter stealing and fouling almost broke the Jazz’s momentum. But since then, the rocket is still obsessed with three points, not in a row, too impatient.<br>In that small lineup, the Rockets can hardly rebound themselves if they miss only three points.<br>In retrospect, the Rockets’defensive problems, as well as their inability to protect their own rebounds, offense can not be prevented, the game can not be played naturally.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/27/Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D'Antoni's strategy was wrong/f38f0e5deaca42e48a3a8c2d7a5de9ac.jpg" alt="Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D&#39;Antoni&#39;s strategy was wrong"><br>​</p>
<h1 id="Decision-making-Errors-of-D’Antoni"><a href="#Decision-making-Errors-of-D’Antoni" class="headerlink" title="** Decision-making Errors of D’Antoni**"></a>** Decision-making Errors of D’Antoni**</h1><p>As for the decision-making of section IV, it is worth discussing. For example, the use of Gerald Green by D’Antoni at the beginning of the fourth section.<br>We have seen the performance of Gerard Green in this series. The first three points are 1, the second one is 0, the third five is 3, and today the fourth one is 2.0. It’s too unstable.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/27/Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D'Antoni's strategy was wrong/887738b9b47c4ebaad15796daa2b027e.jpg" alt="Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D&#39;Antoni&#39;s strategy was wrong"><br>​<br>Such an unstable shooter, however, scored two consecutive, somewhat impatient three points at the beginning of the fourth quarter. The Jazz’s 7-0 was played in these two three-point rounds.<br>The use of Green is more like a double-edged sword, sometimes extremely sharp, see the throat, sometimes, may also hurt themselves.<br>Just after Jazz started 7-0, D’Antoni immediately replaced Green with House. That is to say, D’Antoni himself denied his choice of rotation.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/27/Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D'Antoni's strategy was wrong/7a4d47c1a6e74cfc8eec21577ab792d8.jpg" alt="Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D&#39;Antoni&#39;s strategy was wrong"><br>​<br>Another decision-making mistake is related to the rotation of Fervus and Capella.<br>Fevos has a big advantage against the small team. Although Tucker can squeeze out the position, the gap between Tucker and Fevos is too big. The Rockets’collective protection of rebounds as a whole is also somewhat arbitrary.<br>D’Antoni replaced Capella so slowly that the Rockets could not get rebounds and had missed the best chance to chase points.<br>Because of Mitchell’s good condition, the Jazz beat Mitchell and Fervus to the death. Fervus was more flexible to follow up, and repeatedly followed up when Capella chased Mitchell to make up the basket.<br>In fact, it was Fervus’three consecutive rounds of front rebounds and the rocket’s out-of-bounds, the baseline ball followed by the air-cut hoop buckle, and the two subsequent buckles after the block and tear down, which almost locked the game in.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/27/Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D'Antoni's strategy was wrong/e3eeb07c874b4ca394aea48bbb497455.jpg" alt="Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D&#39;Antoni&#39;s strategy was wrong"><br>​<br>Salt Lake City people are stubborn and resilient, and their will to fight in the last two games is admirable. Today’s Jazz team is certainly the more deserving side.<br>But the series results are still cold 3-1, rockets occupy an absolute advantage, the Jazz came to the Rockets home can play this backwater momentum is not yet clear.<br>The initiative to end the series is still in the hands of the Rockets, but the Rockets need to be more serious and put more effort into it.</p>
