The real challenge for the Lakers and the Clippers is coming"><br>In the NBA pre-season, which ended in the morning of October 6th, sir, the Jazz won 36 points in Australia at the home 133-81. In this game, Berg Bogdanovic, Kang Li and Wu did not appear, and the Jazz coach gave him more opportunities. In the eyes of multi-American media, the West really strong team, in the first game of the new season, showed a strong offensive firepower!<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/06/Fifty-two points win, another great power in the West chooses showdown! The real challenge for the Lakers and the Clippers is coming/0da889aeec63436493c78c87408d3ecb.jpg" alt="Fifty-two points win, another great power in the West chooses showdown! The real challenge for the Lakers and the Clippers is coming"><br>First look at the jazz player data, Berg Bogdanovic 10 points 4 assists and 4 rebounds, Jeff Green 16 points and 2 rebounds, 8 8 points 7 rebounds, 10 10 points 6 assists, 12 12 points 6 assists, scores 6 rebounds, score points, the score is double, which is built on the team’s lack of former scorers.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/06/Fifty-two points win, another great power in the West chooses showdown!

The real challenge for the Lakers and the Clippers is coming"><br>In fact, the 36 person team is not weak, the two sides played very well, but by the end of the first quarter, the Jazz scored 12-0 points in a wave of 12-0, the breakthrough in Jeff Green, the three points in the middle distance, and the new jazz support system was almost the tactical system for the seamlessly butting the team, and this summer has been in the whirlpool of the trade, scoring 7 points in 5. Negative + 30 responds to the team’s final choice. Even without three top players, the Jazz now has nine players to rotate, which is terrible!<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/06/Fifty-two points win, another great power in the West chooses showdown!

The real challenge for the Lakers and the Clippers is coming"><br>The three-quarter lead was 41 points, and the final score was 133-81!<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/06/Fifty-two points win, another great power in the West chooses showdown!

The real challenge for the Lakers and the Clippers is coming"><br>In the Lakers and warriors game, the two sides also gave their new season predictions. Chris Webb’s prediction for the top eight of the new season is: clippers, Nuggets, Lakers, pioneers, jazz, spurs and lone Rangers. Webb believes that the upper limit of jazz is still in Mitchell, and the prospect of Conley and Mitchell’s cooperation is unknown.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/06/Fifty-two points win, another great power in the West chooses showdown! The real challenge for the Lakers and the Clippers is coming/133c0d9002a74472ae838e7de77e02a5.jpg" alt="Fifty-two points win, another great power in the West chooses showdown! The real challenge for the Lakers and the Clippers is coming"><br>But Reggie Miller put forward different opinions. Of course, the Clippers and the Lakers are obvious, but the Jazz are still a dynamic team. Like the Clippers, the overall strength is balanced and there is no obvious weakness. They also added a number of outside shooters in the summer, such as Green, Bogdan and Bradley, who have outside shooting ability. So in Reggie Miller’s mind, the top eight places in the West are Nuggets, Clippers, Jazz, Lakers, Trailblazers, Warriors and Rangers.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/06/Fifty-two points win, another great power in the West chooses showdown!

The real challenge for the Lakers and the Clippers is coming"><br>No matter which rankings, they want to get into the top eight in the brutal West. It is very difficult. In the past two years, the Jazz have fallen to the same team for the two time because of the lack of support from the side, but the jazz of the new season is definitely worth looking forward to. Today, we can see the Lakers’ game. It took 18 minutes to finish the game. The clipper debut is on the way. The cruel West is starting to compete, but don’t neglect the Jazz coming back.</p>

    <title>Five big stars who did not reach the finals 2 active players, average 33 points at the second peak, the first is too bad</title>
    <url>/2019/07/31/Five%20big%20stars%20who%20did%20not%20reach%20the%20finals%202%20active%20players,%20average%2033%20points%20at%20the%20second%20peak,%20the%20first%20is%20too%20bad/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/31/Five big stars who did not reach the finals 2 active players, average 33 points at the second peak, the first is too bad/14552c6cade64a80b9dc9dad552ecca6.jpg" alt="Five big stars who did not reach the finals 2 active players, average 33 points at the second peak, the first is too bad"><br>​<br>In the 70 years of NBA history, there are too many players who failed to win a championship ring and retired, full of regret. Even those who won the championship, were selected for a while and even got MVP, there are many players who did not win the championship, even those who did not reach the finals.<br>Among the stars who have not been to the finals, the first few are all famous figures. Cameron Anthony, who has no ball to play, is one of the hot topics in recent years.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/31/Five big stars who did not reach the finals 2 active players, average 33 points at the second peak, the first is too bad/5e67589275864e8d9fa924cdc005f7c1.jpg" alt="Five big stars who did not reach the finals 2 active players, average 33 points at the second peak, the first is too bad"><br>​<br>The best result of Anthony’s career in the playoffs was the Western Finals, the 2008-2009 Western Finals, where Anthony’s leading Nuggets met Kobe Bryant’s Lakers.<br>In that series, Anthony did well. He averaged 27.5 points, 4.8 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game, but what he met was a really mature Kobe Bryant and the complete Lakers. Kobe Bryant averaged 34 points, 5.8 rebounds and 5.8 assists per game, even 2.2 errors per game were better than Anthony’s 2.8. Such Kobe Bryant, such a “king of the West” performance, can only let Anthony defeat.<br>But I didn’t think that since then, Anthony’s treatment in his late career has gone from bad to worse. Kobe Bryant has retired tours, and Anthony’s retired tours even need to be a topic of debate. It’s a bit of a shame to be discussed about the past.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/31/Five big stars who did not reach the finals 2 active players, average 33 points at the second peak, the first is too bad/e8833051f26847ef83b393d39d39bea3.jpg" alt="Five big stars who did not reach the finals 2 active players, average 33 points at the second peak, the first is too bad"><br>​<br>Donnie Mick Wilkins seems to be somewhat similar to Anthony’s situation. Wilkins, who is the essence of human movie, is actually a super scorer. He has 24.8 points in his career and thirteenth place in NBA history. But the best shooting guard of his generation is Michael Jordan.<br>In fact, Wilkins was not very lucky. His playoff opponents were either the Celtics in the 1980s, the two consecutive championships in the late 1980s and even the Pistons that blocked Jordan out of the Finals, and then Jordan, which made Wilkins not even go east in his entire career. In the final, he stopped the Eastern Semi-Finals four times, which really means “how can you make your life bright?”<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/31/Five big stars who did not reach the finals 2 active players, average 33 points at the second peak, the first is too bad/2548ce33a47b45758f032338b430fc0c.jpg" alt="Five big stars who did not reach the finals 2 active players, average 33 points at the second peak, the first is too bad"><br>​<br>In fact, in addition to Anthony, there is another star who has not yet touched the finals, Chris Paul.<br>Paul’s career is full of honors, but it is this “Western Decision” that has become Paul’s life enemy. Before arriving at the Rockets, Paul’s journey to the Western Conference was rough and arduous. The closest one, in the playoffs of 2015, Paul defeated the defending champion Spurs in the first round, but was dramatically reversed by the Rockets’1-3 lag in the second round, which basically laid the end of the breakup of the Clippers. 。<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/31/Five big stars who did not reach the finals 2 active players, average 33 points at the second peak, the first is too bad/6f39b58ad69b40b6afa7ea50365403b8.jpg" alt="Five big stars who did not reach the finals 2 active players, average 33 points at the second peak, the first is too bad"><br>​<br>After arriving at the Rockets, Paul finally had a taste of the Western Conference finals, but in the good situation of the original team, his injury changed the balance of the series, and finally stopped one step away from the Finals, never returned to the same height.<br>Now Paul has been sent to the Thunder and it’s incredibly difficult to get back to the Finals.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/31/Five big stars who did not reach the finals 2 active players, average 33 points at the second peak, the first is too bad/65ab0865a201416c9452c9b16470336a.jpg" alt="Five big stars who did not reach the finals 2 active players, average 33 points at the second peak, the first is too bad"><br>​<br>One of the stars whose career regrets have not reached the finals is “Iceman” George Gwen, who scored four times and five times in a while. Only those of James or Durant who can compete with this honor in active service have scored 26.2 points in the career field, ranking 10th in NBA history. At the peak of his career, Gwen is also able to compete. A monster scorer with an average of 33 points, but playoff Gwen was also reversed by a 3-1 lead in the Eastern Finals and failed to reach the Finals.<br>The most unfortunate superstar who has not reached the finals is Nash who won MVP twice. Nash won MVP both in the Sun and in two successive MVPs. Nash explained the definition of MVP with the Sun, which had won only 29 games in the previous season, and 62 wins in just one season.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/31/Five big stars who did not reach the finals 2 active players, average 33 points at the second peak, the first is too bad/824574973b7649dbb4acfebf72ab2854.jpg" alt="Five big stars who did not reach the finals 2 active players, average 33 points at the second peak, the first is too bad"><br>​<br>But such Nash, in the playoffs is a little sad, his career into the Western Finals four times, but four times are regrettable defeat, but in fact, Nash’s latest time from the Finals may not be four times, but the 2006-07 season of the Western Semi-Finals.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/31/Five big stars who did not reach the finals 2 active players, average 33 points at the second peak, the first is too bad/907237cbb0e6460cb00a87dc1416b39a.jpg" alt="Five big stars who did not reach the finals 2 active players, average 33 points at the second peak, the first is too bad"><br>​<br>In the semi-finals, G4 Horry viciously crashed into Nash, triggering a conflict between the two sides, the Suns will be banned, which may be the strongest form of the Suns team, so helpless out. Whether it’s the Mavericks’decision in the early days of his career or the Lakers’ attempt to chase the championship at the end of his career, Nash has not been able to go any further. It’s a pity for the basketball guard who is smart enough to be a good point guard.</p>

    <title>Great victory over pioneers! The sun was mad, 24 minutes and three points, and Ubrey couldn&#39;t stop laughing</title>
    <url>/2019/10/14/Great%20victory%20over%20pioneers!%20The%20sun%20was%20mad,%2024%20minutes%20and%20three%20points,%20and%20Ubrey%20couldn&#39;t%20stop%20laughing/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>At the end of today’s pre-season, the Suns beat the Blazers 134-118 away. The performance of the Suns in this match is very impressive, because today Buck and Eton and Rubio are all absent, but the Suns are playing like a tiger, using the remnants to face the Blazers three quarters to punch out.<br>From the beginning of the first quarter, the sun showed his desire to attack. Ubray was the first soldier. He attacked the Blazers in a row and scored four points in a row. Baines also hit three points, followed by Baines and Ubrey play a duet, a blockbuster assault and get two points.<br>Under the impact of Ubrey and Baines, the Sun started 16-6.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Great victory over pioneers! The sun was mad, 24 minutes and three points, and Ubrey couldn't stop laughing/5400e1457d54497c9ee4b526ae8a421e.jpg" alt="Great victory over pioneers! The sun was mad, 24 minutes and three points, and Ubrey couldn&#39;t stop laughing"><br>Of course, the pioneers did not wait to die. Betsmore and Lillard scored 8 points in a row, the Blazers responded 8-0, and the Blazers were one point ahead in the first quarter. But in the second quarter, the sun rose again, Sharich was unstoppable, the sun hit a wave of 11-2, the difference will be directly opened to 11 points.<br>The Blazers were still 58-65 down in the first half, and the Suns continued to attack in the second half. Three-thirds of a million arrows, Kaminski hit in a row. The Sun blossomed the game in the third quarter, and the two sides began to change their main players in the last quarter.<br>The Suns showed horrible teamwork and seven of them scored double. Ubrey scored 19 points, 3 rebounds and 1 assistant in 5 of 11 shots, of which 3 were from 5 of 3-point shots.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Great victory over pioneers! The sun was mad, 24 minutes and three points, and Ubrey couldn't stop laughing/f26d01cad3a449c8a55acd7fbab28be0.jpg" alt="Great victory over pioneers! The sun was mad, 24 minutes and three points, and Ubrey couldn&#39;t stop laughing"><br>Today’s Aubrey really carried the team and became the leader. Other teammates Bridges scored 13 points, Sharich 13 points, Baines 14 points, Kaminski 16 points, Cameron Johnson 18 points, 2 rebounds and 1 board assists, Taylor Johnson 18 points.<br>The Suns shot 24 of the 45 points in the game, 24 of which hit three points, breaking the team’s record, this is the pre-season regular season and the playoffs, the Suns hit the most three points in a single game.<br>The pioneers scored 18 points for Lillard and 27 for McLemo, but the crazy sun was hard to stop.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Great victory over pioneers! The sun was mad, 24 minutes and three points, and Ubrey couldn't stop laughing/6f5bc8cf871948b4b6808abb3a693440.jpg" alt="Great victory over pioneers! The sun was mad, 24 minutes and three points, and Ubrey couldn&#39;t stop laughing"><br>The Suns’current squad is really weak, and they should not go to pieces next season. Because the team’s strength and talent are enough, there is no need to rebuild by putting it on the back burner. Buck can go to the point guard, he has a qualified passing master, Rubio can join the team.<br>In addition, the top runner up, Ron Aton, also grew up last season. As a flank, Aubrey also showed the potential of an all star. The Suns deserve to play in the playoffs. They have the strength to prove themselves in the West, not to remain silent.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Great victory over pioneers! The sun was mad, 24 minutes and three points, and Ubrey couldn't stop laughing/8ac447f9ef064f34b0658261d99288f7.jpg" alt="Great victory over pioneers! The sun was mad, 24 minutes and three points, and Ubrey couldn&#39;t stop laughing"><br>As we all know last season, the league is boycotting the pendulum and Zion Williams was picked by the pelican. The Pelican gets the champion’s ticket, in fact, to a certain extent, it is punishing those squandered teams. Now the Sun should wake up like a dream. For Ubrey, next season is a good time for him to explode.<br>It’s just that for pioneers, today’s failure is frustrating. Lillard apologized publicly when he talked about defeat after the game. He thought the team’s performance was very bad, including him, and could not bring it to the regular season.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Great victory over pioneers! The sun was mad, 24 minutes and three points, and Ubrey couldn't stop laughing/6d991a3eb58f45098ee51d442aedd804.jpg" alt="Great victory over pioneers! The sun was mad, 24 minutes and three points, and Ubrey couldn&#39;t stop laughing"><br>Lillard said: “Today is a terrible game, compared to last season we started to rust. We need to increase communication, including me, which is not very good today. In addition, there are defensive exchanges, as well as protection of the ball. I know it’s just a pre-season without fuss, but we still need to do better.</p>

    <title>Harden&#39;s offense against Jordan, the defense can be the best in the league Is the Rocket management awkward</title>

After all, the team that won the biggest this summer, it should be the Clippers, retaining the super substitute of Lu Wei + Harel, and the super-frontline of Paul George and Leonard on the starting line. The team’s construction is reasonable, the lineup is strong, the new season is not beyond the achievements of last season, but directed to the championship and went;<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/09/18/Harden's offense against Jordan, the defense can be the best in the league Is the Rocket management awkward/efb1d6b140964cd8803017cd423b20ad.jpg" alt="Harden&#39;s offense against Jordan, the defense can be the best in the league Is the Rocket management awkward"><br>But what about the most eye-catching management in the offseason? That must be the Rockets. First of all, the operation of the Rockets is quite amazing. Paul’s gradually increasing state is gradually declining. The Rockets have fallen in front of the Warriors year after year, and the management has been painstakingly seeking to change. So Harden + Wei Shao’s MVP combination It was born, according to the Rockets management, the transaction from the plan to the official occurrence, it took only more than a week, the Rockets’ decisive and resolutely popular is a deep impression.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/09/18/Harden's offense against Jordan, the defense can be the best in the league Is the Rocket management awkward/3175adce0e6f44418d84ff268904b90a.jpg" alt="Harden&#39;s offense against Jordan, the defense can be the best in the league Is the Rocket management awkward"><br>But the Rockets management’s eye-catching place is not only these, but the later content, but it makes people feel a bit inexplicable, especially the Rockets’ top star Harden feels a little embarrassed.<br>This matter has to start from Morey. Morey throws a point of view when he participates in a talk show in the summer. It can be described as a blockbuster. Even the two hosts at the time were shocked by Morey’s remarks. Morey The point is that Harden is a better scorer than Jordan.<br>“I know that the objections will come very much. They will say that you put Jordan in a certain team. He will do more than Harden. It is possible, but if you just look back at history, see you. How many points your team can score after giving the ball to this person, that is Harden, I know that many people will be angry with me, but this is the truth.” Morey based on the data directly to get Harden scoring ability super Jordan The assertion seems to have lost some reason.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/09/18/Harden's offense against Jordan, the defense can be the best in the league Is the Rocket management awkward/12183f29561242bcb6eb24b49eb456bd.jpg" alt="Harden&#39;s offense against Jordan, the defense can be the best in the league Is the Rocket management awkward"><br>Then the Rockets owner Fettita, the boss is also participating in the show, he mentioned Harden’s defense this time, he said: “When Harden wants to defend seriously, no one in the league is better than him. “<br>Of course, it sounds like Fatita’s remarks are ridiculous, but at least he added a precondition, but praised Harden’s defense, which has been criticized in the past few years, is still a strange thing.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/09/18/Harden's offense against Jordan, the defense can be the best in the league Is the Rocket management awkward/3139b4df7e2c49c99954077805792557.jpg" alt="Harden&#39;s offense against Jordan, the defense can be the best in the league Is the Rocket management awkward"><br>An offensive Super Jordan, the defense can reach the best players in the league as long as they want to think.

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today, the Clippers defeated Melbourne United 118-100 in the NBA preseason. Two Clippers, Leonard and George, were absent from the game. Melbourne United were also very good. In the first half, they kept a firm grip on the Clippers because the two superstars were not there. Leading to the beginning is really not giving strength.<br>But Old Rivers still ambushed, not Harrell and Louis in the starting line-up, but continue to be on the bench. In this way, there are many times in today’s competition when the Clippers lose points and the substitutes come up to chase points.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Hit hard! The Clippers won the game and five people were injured. Old Rivers made a great decision. Two people were absent in the closing game/0753ff03e7d24ebdbcd375662be5aa35.jpg" alt="Hit hard! The Clippers won the game and five people were injured. Old Rivers made a great decision. Two people were absent in the closing game"><br>If it hadn’t been for the Clippers’replacement Shuangxiong, the Clippers would have lost today. Because the Clippers were four points behind in the first half. In the second half, the Clippers sounded the counter-attack horn, and it was Rowe and Harrel who helped the Clippers get 43 points in a single quarter to blow the game in an instant.<br>Among them, Luwe’s score and series, Harrel’s bread in the basket, but the key to the Clipper’s ability to turn the table. But the Australian team was really strong, and it started off against the Clippers physically.<br>And Melbourne united with tacit understanding, but the Clippers are too strong. The Clippers won, but Old Rivers couldn’t be happy. The reason is that the injury wave is coming, and today the Clippers have three more players injured.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Hit hard!

Beverly + Shamet + Amir were all injured, Beverly was a calf strain. Shamet suffered from wrist soreness and minor injuries. And Amir sprained his ankle.<br>Although it wasn’t a serious injury, Old Rivers was still making a decision to give the team a day off tomorrow in order to be cautious. I hope this day will bring the whole crew back to health. The Clippers can’t afford to be injured now.<br>In addition to the above three, Paul George and Rodney were also told that they would miss the next preseason, including the closing game, because of injuries.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Hit hard! The Clippers won the game and five people were injured. Old Rivers made a great decision. Two people were absent in the closing game/bba3e2c4db3a467799051eff02726dcb.jpg" alt="Hit hard! The Clippers won the game and five people were injured. Old Rivers made a great decision. Two people were absent in the closing game"><br>At 10:30 a.m. on October 18, Beijing time, the Clippers will finish the game at home against the lone ranger. Old rivers will have to look at the injury of specific personnel and decide who to send.<br>But George Rodney must not be able to take part in the closing battle. It is worth mentioning that Meiji reported before. George may not only miss the preseason, he may miss 10 regular season games.<br>For Leonard, the Clipper now has to rely on him, and Old Rivers had previously stated that Leonard would not take turns like he did in the Raptors.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Hit hard!

The Clippers won the game and five people were injured. Old Rivers made a great decision. Two people were absent in the closing game"><br>Leonard doesn’t need to take a break in the new season. His physical condition is very satisfactory to the clipper. The good thing is that George is not here. But the Clippers are not weak, Leonard + Beverly’s combination can support the first defense, coupled with Zubatz’s growth, and Harrel and Luwe’s combination can also share the pressure for the small card on the bench.<br>The Clippers were able to play six games against the Warriors last season, and their goal in the new season is to win the championship. In order to achieve the championship, the first thing the Clippers need to do is to protect their health.<br>George’s shoulder injury is heartbreaking. In fact, last season, the Thunder pioneer, George was wearing shoulder injury.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Hit hard! The Clippers won the game and five people were injured. Old Rivers made a great decision. Two people were absent in the closing game/77c08f2ce20b4a2ebca597092ad593be.jpg" alt="Hit hard! The Clippers won the game and five people were injured. Old Rivers made a great decision. Two people were absent in the closing game"><br>Beverly himself is not an iron man. Beverly is a double-edged sword for the Clippers. Because Beverly defends fiercely but is also vulnerable to injury, the Clippers use Beverly very handy, but if injured, it is a bit difficult to row. Beverly was traded by a team to the Clippers for two seasons and played only 11 games in his first season.<br>Beverly’s attendance reached its peak last season, with 78 regular-season games and a full playoff season. But it can’t be said that Beverly got rid of injury, because in the past five years Beverly’s regular season attendance has averaged over 50%.</p>

    <title>Hot fire can never compromise! Heywood talked about Butler&#39;s suggestion. Wade I&#39;m focused on Los Angeles</title>
    <url>/2019/10/14/Hot%20fire%20can%20never%20compromise!%20Heywood%20talked%20about%20Butler&#39;s%20suggestion.%20Wade%20I&#39;m%20focused%20on%20Los%20Angeles/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Jimmy Butler landed in Miami this summer and became the new emperor of the Heat. After Wade retired, the Heat have been looking for a superstar to lead the team. Butler is undoubtedly the most suitable player, he is diligent and enterprising. Butler is not strong in terms of physical talent, even a little mediocre.<br>Because Butler is 2.01 metres high on the flank and has a poor 2.03 metres arms. This limits Butler’s ceiling, otherwise he might be even stronger now.<br>Well, Butler’s current level is also superstar. What can we judge whether a player is a superstar or not? It’s to lead the team into the playoffs.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Hot fire can never compromise! Heywood talked about Butler's suggestion. Wade I'm focused on Los Angeles/07aec1e0c3084603be6627f4dbcaa220.jpg" alt="Hot fire can never compromise! Heywood talked about Butler&#39;s suggestion. Wade I&#39;m focused on Los Angeles"><br>Only the players who lead the mononuclear team into the playoffs can be considered real superstars. While Butler was at the bulls, he led the team into the playoffs. When we went to the Timberwolves, we also brought the team of Ten Thousand Years Fish Bowl into the playoffs, which broke the two gifted monsters of Wiggins and Downs.<br>If Wiggins’talent were given to Butler, it would be doubtful who would be the first in the current coalition. How much influence does Butler have on the team? Butler had previously revealed that he was getting up at 3:30 a.m. every day and then going to the gym to practice hard.<br>Butler is looking forward to being the boss of the Heat. He dreams of being the boss. The Heat will undoubtedly regard him as the real core. It was a pity that the Heat missed the playoffs last season.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Hot fire can never compromise! Heywood talked about Butler's suggestion. Wade I'm focused on Los Angeles/14a15c5d28d441cd9bd4fe91e2729122.jpg" alt="Hot fire can never compromise! Heywood talked about Butler&#39;s suggestion. Wade I&#39;m focused on Los Angeles"><br>But Butler has one disadvantage that he doesn’t know if he will change, that is, he has a strong desire to control. Whether it’s a bull or a timber wolf, the dressing room explodes. Because Butler likes to control his teammates, it will not satisfy some young people.<br>This was especially mentioned by former NBA player Brandon Heywood on his visit to NBA TV. Heywood believes Butler has to learn from the past, as he influenced the entire dressing room when the bulls and Timberwolves played.<br>Now joining the Heat, Heywood believes that Butler should be more temperamental, not to allow coach Spollestra and God operator Riley difficult to do.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Hot fire can never compromise! Heywood talked about Butler's suggestion. Wade I'm focused on Los Angeles/31a953a76ea747b789aa1191d14f1d6a.jpg" alt="Hot fire can never compromise! Heywood talked about Butler&#39;s suggestion. Wade I&#39;m focused on Los Angeles"><br>“Butler can be integrated into the hot culture, but I hope he can learn from his past failures,” Heywood said. He spoiled the atmosphere in the dressing room when he was working with the bulls and the timberwolves. Everyone is wondering what kind of player Butler is. As a player, I think Butler is perfect. Last season, at a critical moment for 76 players, Butler was the first point of possession, not Simmons and Embed. So I don’t think it’s a problem for Butler to integrate into the Heat. But off the court, I hope Butler can respect the team culture of the Heat, because the Heat will never compromise because of any individual.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Hot fire can never compromise! Heywood talked about Butler's suggestion. Wade I'm focused on Los Angeles/f6786bd1eedd4899b460c22b761b19ef.jpg" alt="Hot fire can never compromise! Heywood talked about Butler&#39;s suggestion. Wade I&#39;m focused on Los Angeles"><br>Yes, Heywood warned Butler that you can play freely on the court and you have unlimited right to fire. But don’t try to turn the Heat into your own world off the court.<br>Because this is not Butler’s, the city’s winning culture was built by Wade. But Wade didn’t care whether Butler could join the team or not.<br>A reporter asked Wade. Do you have any suggestions for Butler? Wade made a suggestion, hoping Butler would lead the team to a seat in the east.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Hot fire can never compromise! Heywood talked about Butler's suggestion. Wade I'm focused on Los Angeles/5697ead44a5a44028138a127c869f16a.jpg" alt="Hot fire can never compromise! Heywood talked about Butler&#39;s suggestion. Wade I&#39;m focused on Los Angeles"><br>As for his relationship with the Heat, Wade believes his current focus is on developing in Los Angeles. His wife is in Los Angeles and he has no time to watch Miami. Wade said: “I haven’t paid much attention to Miami lately because I’ve had a good time in Los Angeles and I can focus on my daughter’s growth. And again, I’m not ready to return. I’m used to retirement.<br>There is LeBron James in Los Angeles. It’s worth mentioning that Wade bought a luxury house in Los Angeles the moment James joined the Lakers.</p>

    <title>How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri&#39;s defense</title>

<h1 id="The-classic-ball-less-transposition"><a href="#The-classic-ball-less-transposition" class="headerlink" title="The classic ball-less transposition"></a>The classic ball-less transposition</h1><p>Take the last round of the Rockets and Warriors G2 half-game as an example.<br>In the last half, the Rockets handed the ball to Harden without any accident. Harden returned to the dressing room with an eye injury and then to the court. But the right-hand position was still there. Harden cut 5, 4 and 12 points in the second quarter, which seemed to have no effect on his hand.<br>At the end of the day, Harden deserves it.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/18/How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri's defense/ae1bf93fbc6d4a428cabc57d82f4ddb3.jpg" alt="How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri&#39;s defense"><br>​<br>When Harden dribbles, the warriors will naturally be Igodara first. While Igodara and Harden were at the top of the arc, Kuri and three other teammates made as many as six defensive changes at the end of the ball.<br>First of all, Curie’s first opponent is Gordon, Clay’s first opponent is Paul, and Gordon’s first opponent runs from the bottom corner to the right side of a brother, trying to go forward and dismantle, so that Harden singles Curie.<br>At this time, Curie shouted directly, reminding Clay around, Clay went straight to the right stop, two people directly a mismatch, Curie on Paul, and Gordon on Clay. In this way, Harden borrowed Gordon’s gear and still wanted Clay singles.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/18/How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri's defense/8788568b0b6a4fd181965b09b61ef030.jpg" alt="How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri&#39;s defense"><br>​<br>Then Paul, who had no ball, rushed Gordon to the bottom left corner, trying to empty the side and take Curie over. Clay turned around again, went straight to Paul again, and Curie ran straight to Gordon again. Don’t let Paul’s plan succeed.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/18/How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri's defense/72a8bd04fdc4456c86a7a9d856b258cf.jpg" alt="How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri&#39;s defense"><br>​<br>And if there is no accident, then according to the rocket’s plan, Gordon has to go forward again, and then Curie and Durant complete another ball-free shift, Durant against Gordon, and Curie runs to the bottom corner of Little Rivers.<br>Another change of position, let the rocket change defense singles library idea disappear again.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/18/How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri's defense/daa0077c0ecd467a8e3703c3d5243cbe.jpg" alt="How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri&#39;s defense"><br>​<br>Eventually, Curie, Durant and Green crossed the ball-free ends of the three men in the bottom left corner. Even if Tucker was raised again, Durant would follow Tucker forward, and Harden would even face Durant after the change.<br>Curie followed Little Rivers slowly to the bottom corner of the right.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/18/How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri's defense/f6cec38e382248cebc59256a6b2d211d.jpg" alt="How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri&#39;s defense"><br>​<br>After a series of ball-free shifts, Harden and his brother were at the top of the arc, attacking time from 24 seconds to consume the last 5 seconds before Harden began to bow to the singles, the singles target is still standing at the top of the arc Igodara.<br>Of course, with only five seconds left in the ball, Harden was able to shake Igodara off with a good rhythm and shoot three points, but in the sense of tactical execution, the Rockets failed in this round.<br>On the one hand, they want to consume the Kuri who has fouled twice and dared not easily start. On the other hand, the success rate of Harden’s singles Kuri is relatively high, which is also the easiest point to break through in the Five Deaths.<br>But if we can’t achieve the effect of the singles warehouse all the time, breaking through or shooting in the face of a brother’s defense in the whole game will consume Harden’s own physical strength.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/18/How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri's defense/ae9c746e2057472f8b27b156609c7949.jpg" alt="How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri&#39;s defense"><br>​<br>This change of position without the ball end is actually a change made by the warriors in their fatal confrontation with the knights. James Curie singles, not only in the cover of Curie’s big delay in withdrawal, but also this classic ball-less defensive coordination.<br>These are the details of the game, and may not be noticed by the majority of fans, but the Warriors can do this with the ultimate cooperation of the five smallest deaths. This is also the reason why both ends of the attack and defense of the five minor deaths can rule.<br>They can change infinitely at the defensive end, and they can also protect the Kuri without a ball in time. At the same time, the huge threat of the Kuri at the offensive end and the ultimate talent of the entire lineup are rarely matched by their opponents.<br>This is the complete and terrible death of five small.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/18/How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri's defense/dd2daa181a0e468f92e4bd5125434064.jpg" alt="How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri&#39;s defense"><br>​</p>
<h1 id="Dream-chase-and-Durant’s-co-defense"><a href="#Dream-chase-and-Durant’s-co-defense" class="headerlink" title="Dream chase and Durant’s co-defense"></a>Dream chase and Durant’s co-defense</h1><p>Warriors die five small, Kuri’s defensive level is the weakest, but there is also an average level. If Curie can improve his starting problems, then his defensive level is even above the average level.<br>In addition to Curie, Clay’s single defense ability is the top, one brother’s single defense ability is the top, one-hand cutting and pulling the ball technology is the league’s own step.<br>In addition to these three players, the pursuit of dreams is DPOY, Durant’s natural physical advantages make him both single defense and co-defense are quite threatening.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/18/How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri's defense/7d2be585dfd14dd7973a491bace0e143.jpg" alt="How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri&#39;s defense"><br>​<br>Dream-chasing is of course the player who supports the whole warrior defense system. His ability, timing and deterrence of cooperation will become the existence of deterrence opponents.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/18/How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri's defense/b01a4c89dbc14f12a0d0f09175d56dfc.jpg" alt="How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri&#39;s defense"><br>​<br>Whether it’s to make up for opponents’shifting balls, to make offensive fouls by judging opponents’ breakthrough routes, or to send bloody hats at the right time, it seems that dream-chasing always gives the strongest support behind teammates. This, of course, is why he won DPOY.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/18/How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri's defense/39bc2221d74348c2a52a523652d296d0.jpg" alt="How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri&#39;s defense"><br>​<br>Durant’s career cap has never been uncommon. Most people do not know that Durant’s career cap has exceeded the total number of James’s bloodcap.<br>And this round of rockets that directly supplement Fan Fei Ha-bo shot has become a classic G1 picture.<br>His blocked caps in this series are not small at all. Outside of the single defence Harden’s catching up, the G2 first round directly confronted Capella’s blooded cap opponents, as well as the three-point blocked cap. Durant, even Harden-level scorers, who carefully defended, had to weigh up.<br>In fact, Durant’s biggest defensive weakness is his rebound protection, which he has repeatedly encountered in the regular season, but in the playoffs, Durant, who is more focused, has not made too many of these problems. In rebounding, the warriors are better than the rockets.<br>Capella’s top defense in this series, Durant’s top defense in the face of pursuing dreams, he did not have too many opportunities to eat inside. In addition, when the warriors hold the ball bag and Hudden passes the ball and delivers the cake, they often fly out a brother or Clay to intercept directly from the air.<br>The Rockets were not good at passing and cutting, and they were not too dare to show their passing in front of the Warriors, but their most powerful stars were singled out, and now there is only one Harden left.<br>Paul’s single-handedness and athletic condition declined sharply. With Harden’s one-man shot or breakthrough, the Warriors have experienced James’s impact, which must not be too afraid.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/18/How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri's defense/128ac26df7f4435287bc7e067b5d985e.jpg" alt="How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri&#39;s defense"><br>​</p>
<h1 id="The-Extension-of-Curie’s-Foul-Problem"><a href="#The-Extension-of-Curie’s-Foul-Problem" class="headerlink" title="The Extension of Curie’s Foul Problem"></a>The Extension of Curie’s Foul Problem</h1><p>But in the five minor deaths of the warriors, the problem still comes to Kuri. On the one hand, the riddled cylinders of Curie and the different treatment of referees;<br>On the other hand, Curie’s hand-eye coordination ability is really strong, and his ability is also reflected in his starting speed, sometimes even a reflex shot, but often fined fouls.<br>One elder brother also commented on Curie’s treatment.<br>“He’s the only superstar who’s got five fouls. I don’t know. It’s a headache. Sometimes I feel like,’Oh, just that, you don’t need to start, just let him go. Said Igodara.<br>On the one hand, what one brother said is some hidden complaints about referees, on the other hand, the latter part of the content of one brother, the so-called “you don’t need to start, let him go in the past,” said the point.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/18/How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri's defense/9a96621e3ecc4b359a226b969469934a.jpg" alt="How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri&#39;s defense"><br>​<br>That’s the extra requirement Cole has for Curie, and it’s absolutely more important for the team to stay on the pitch than to let the opponents get those two points. What’s more, the Warriors have never sought too reliable point guards, because the team has too much resources to hold the ball.<br>So if Curie can stay on the court, the warrior’s system and offensive space will always remain a great deterrent, which is also called the “reservoir attraction” that Curie can create opportunities even without taking the ball.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/18/How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri's defense/b0d558774dab49f386b3451265a5c881.jpg" alt="How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri&#39;s defense"><br>​<br>Curie should also be more confident about the team’s complementary and co-ordinated defense, sometimes allowing opponents to break through from the side, inviting him to enter the interior to face Durant or Green’s hat is a better choice.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/18/How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri's defense/c86dfb2026434c4ebbdd41f46e024915.jpg" alt="How can the Five Deaths of the Golden State Warriors make up for Kuri&#39;s defense"><br>​<br>There is no need to elaborate on the attack power of the Five Deaths. In the G2 victory over the Rockets, all the five Warriors who died scored more than or equal to 15 points in the first round, which is also the first time in the history of the playoffs, which highlights their horrible firepower.<br>Attack wins the box office, defense wins the championship, and death is a combination of attack and defense. That’s where they can really chill their opponents.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/14/How does the G6 win Barcelona spoke. The Warriors needed the whole team to make up for the KD vacancy/ccf8ab5391cd4c46bb7880f4844715e0.jpg" alt="How does the G6 win Barcelona spoke. The Warriors needed the whole team to make up for the KD vacancy"><br>​<br>“KD can’t be replaced. He’s now the best basketball player on the planet, so I have to say that it takes the whole Warriors team to make up for it.” Former Warrior and tough man Matt Barnes spoke to Bay Area media today about the impact of Durant’s absence on the Warriors.<br>“Luni has to stand up, there are other rookie point guards, they also need to stand up. It must take the whole team’s hard work. The former Warriors relied too much on KD and even reached a passive situation. Now that KD has gone out, I think the Warriors need to go back to the pattern they used to be familiar with, back to the pattern they were most familiar with in the past 4-5 years, and keep shifting the ball.<br>“Of course, what worries me most is the depth of their lineup. After losing Corsins, they have some difficulties. Their benches are not as strong as they used to be. Now they have lost Kevin Durant, which will put their lineup depth to a more serious test. So the others of the Warriors must learn to stand up.” Barnes said.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/14/How does the G6 win Barcelona spoke. The Warriors needed the whole team to make up for the KD vacancy/d6a7e96a4fcc41f8817cc92ce90bdf76.jpg" alt="How does the G6 win Barcelona spoke. The Warriors needed the whole team to make up for the KD vacancy"><br>​<br>The so-called “Team Effort” mentioned by Barthes is a key point. Durant’s value is that the rest of the Warriors can not be replaced, his indifferent singles, his basketball, his guard frame, are the dependence of the Warriors.<br>But when Durant decides he can’t play in the next game, the first thing the Warriors need to think about is not finding another Kevin Durant, but telling the three-time champions that everyone needs to work hard at this time, otherwise there will be no chance.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/14/How does the G6 win Barcelona spoke.

For example, can water spray maintain a high level of performance?<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/14/How does the G6 win Barcelona spoke.

The Warriors needed the whole team to make up for the KD vacancy"><br>​<br>Kurikle’s performance in this year’s playoffs is relatively general. Kurikle fired in the first two games of the playoffs, and then adjusted too slowly after being given priority attention, and his condition continued to be depressed.<br>In the final game of the series against the Clippers, Curie suffered an ankle sprain. Later in the series against the Rockets, Kuri dislocated his left finger.<br>It must be said that Kuri’s ankle has not recovered completely, and his finger injury has seriously affected his dribble and layup.<br>So Kuri’s shooting, Kuri’s breakthroughs are significantly lower than his normal level, which is also the reason why Kuri continued to struggle with the Rockets in the first few games of the series.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/14/How does the G6 win Barcelona spoke.

The Warriors needed the whole team to make up for the KD vacancy"><br>​<br>Clay’s playoff performance this year can only be said to be relatively modest, and Clay also suffered a slight ankle sprain in the last game against the Clippers.<br>The 3-2 Warriors went to Houston one game ahead to win the game. It was absolutely necessary for them to open fire at the same time.<br>Three years ago in the G6, the Warriors went to Oklahoma with a 2-3 lag.

For example, Green’s block-and-pull down and fast-break layup, a brother’s attack basket and empty connection.<br>It is self-evident that when Durant, Curie and Clay exist, the rest of the Warriors will have relatively easy opportunities.<br>But when Durant can’t play, the pressure will naturally spread to the rest of the players, at this time, whether they can withstand the pressure is particularly important.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/14/How does the G6 win Barcelona spoke.

    <title>How hard is 1000 points in the Finals Kobe Bryant has 931 points, only one person in active service and more than 600 points in Super Kuri</title>
    <url>/2019/08/06/How%20hard%20is%201000%20points%20in%20the%20Finals%20Kobe%20Bryant%20has%20931%20points,%20only%20one%20person%20in%20active%20service%20and%20more%20than%20600%20points%20in%20Super%20Kuri/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/06/How hard is 1000 points in the Finals Kobe Bryant has 931 points, only one person in active service and more than 600 points in Super Kuri/6b926793d86f4889890e9cc3cf7e6fd0.jpg" alt="How hard is 1000 points in the Finals Kobe Bryant has 931 points, only one person in active service and more than 600 points in Super Kuri"><br>​<br>What are the conditions for 1000 points in the Finals? The most important premise is to enter the Finals first. Even NBA stars and even superstars can satisfy only a few.<br>Being able to reach the finals under the heavy blockade of each division is already a person who can stand at the top of the league. Such people are also top of the pyramid. But to achieve 1000 points in the final, we need not only to stand at the top of the pyramid, but also to maintain there. This requires not only super strength support, some of them. It takes a little bit of luck.<br>Even with a score of 25 points per game, a total of 40 finals will be required. A total of 40 finals will require at least six series matches to reach, and 40 playoffs will be a huge threshold in the NBA, let alone 40 finals.<br>This represents the difficulty of 1000 points in the Finals. In fact, the superstars who can really finish 1000 points in the Finals are basically in the forefront of history.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/06/How hard is 1000 points in the Finals Kobe Bryant has 931 points, only one person in active service and more than 600 points in Super Kuri/a0bc774f175442fb836100c00877c9b5.jpg" alt="How hard is 1000 points in the Finals Kobe Bryant has 931 points, only one person in active service and more than 600 points in Super Kuri"><br>​<br>Let’s take Curie as an example. Curie and his Warriors have risen since the 2014-15 season. They have entered the finals five times in a row. They are still in the more competitive Western Division. This is the first time in the history of the NBA. It is more sufficient to illustrate the strength and domination of the Warriors.<br>Curie also played 28 finals in these five tournaments, averaging 26.46 points per game, ranking tenth in history, but in the five consecutive years of the finals, Curie only accumulated 741 points, ranking 14th in history, side by side with George McCann.<br>In fact, Curie’s total score in the Finals is not low. His total score has surpassed Duncan, Wade, Larry Bird and many famous hosts or gods, but there is still a long way to go before the 1000 points in the Finals.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/06/How hard is 1000 points in the Finals Kobe Bryant has 931 points, only one person in active service and more than 600 points in Super Kuri/5d6e7aaf0a4d440987bb1a0ea4d16548.jpg" alt="How hard is 1000 points in the Finals Kobe Bryant has 931 points, only one person in active service and more than 600 points in Super Kuri"><br>​<br>The strength of this year’s warriors has been weakened and the future is uncertain, but the difficulty of Kuri’s return to the Finals must be increased. Whether his Finals score can continue to increase by 1000 points is not clear now.<br>Even better than Kobe Bryant, who has won five championships and made seven career finals, the total score in the finals is not more than 1,000 points, which is enough to show how difficult this achievement is.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/06/How hard is 1000 points in the Finals Kobe Bryant has 931 points, only one person in active service and more than 600 points in Super Kuri/3c409d8bde3c452f9eb04978f92a00d3.jpg" alt="How hard is 1000 points in the Finals Kobe Bryant has 931 points, only one person in active service and more than 600 points in Super Kuri"><br>​<br>Kobe Bryant made seven finals in his career and won five championships. His total score reached 937 points. He was able to rank 11th in history, but he still lagged behind 1000 points and failed to break through.<br>In fact, throughout the history of the NBA, there were only nine gods who scored 1,000 points in the Finals, among which the Celtics in the Russell period accounted for a lot of places, while only LeBron James scored 1,000 points in the active NBA Finals.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/06/How hard is 1000 points in the Finals Kobe Bryant has 931 points, only one person in active service and more than 600 points in Super Kuri/9591a11f1db64f02a9483f465c474d84.jpg" alt="How hard is 1000 points in the Finals Kobe Bryant has 931 points, only one person in active service and more than 600 points in Super Kuri"><br>​<br>James made eight consecutive finals in our opinion, but in fact it is a rare miracle. James, who has made nine finals trips in his career, has scored more than 1,000 points in the finals and reached 1383 points, ranking second in history. Only Jerry West (1679), who was the first in history, has scored more than 1,000 points in the finals. Less than 300 points.<br>This summer, the Lakers changed their lineup, the combination of James and Fueyebrow, and the team’s excellent players made it more realistic for James to return to the Finals. Even though James is over 34 and a half years old this year, James’s name has this magical power.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/06/How hard is 1000 points in the Finals Kobe Bryant has 931 points, only one person in active service and more than 600 points in Super Kuri/4aeb6dbdc38249319ad3c6b9e533fa63.jpg" alt="How hard is 1000 points in the Finals Kobe Bryant has 931 points, only one person in active service and more than 600 points in Super Kuri"><br>​<br>But the difficulty of hitting the first place in history is still not small. This is not a finals can be completed. Even if Rick Barry scored 36.3 points in the 296 points in the finals, it would take at least eight games, that is to say, at least two finals trips, if James were to do it himself. Average 28.2 points per game, the seventh speed in history, also need more than 10 games.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/06/How hard is 1000 points in the Finals Kobe Bryant has 931 points, only one person in active service and more than 600 points in Super Kuri/6194e228161445bba16aee119e9d3213.jpg" alt="How hard is 1000 points in the Finals Kobe Bryant has 931 points, only one person in active service and more than 600 points in Super Kuri"><br>​<br>What’s more, from the horrible West to the finals, we also need to face the fast boats of small cards and pickled peppers, the Rockets of Weishao and Harden, and the rest of the strong teams are watching eagerly. It’s not easy to talk about a hundred-foot pole. James’s score of 1383 in the second finals of history is legendary. Let’s think about it again. There are possibilities in the history of the Finals, but it is particularly difficult at the age of 34.</p>

I regret that I couldn't play with him/c3ee1de267204e469535786b60b63fb9.jpg" alt="I have worked with O&#39;Neill and Gasol, but Kobe Bryant is a close relative. I regret that I couldn&#39;t play with him"><br>​<br>“I know what a competitive player he is, and I know we’ll be a perfect match together. We talked about what to do next and how to achieve our goals step by step. Unfortunately, this opportunity will never come again.”<br>After retirement, Bryant talked about his career, about his 20-year career in the Lakers, the most regrettable thing is that he did not mention Jordan in the public opinion, but mentioned such a person. He also said that, unfortunately, he never got the chance to work with him.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/14/I have worked with O'Neill and Gasol, but Kobe Bryant is a close relative.

I regret that I couldn&#39;t play with him"><br>​<br>In fact, Kobe’s career has been called a resounding one, with its peak, valley, injury, unruly youth, heroic loneliness in the middle of his career, maturity and evolution in the later stage, injury and self-struggle at the end of his career, and the final perfect curtain call.<br>Kobe Bryant’s career began with O’Neill, one of the most dominant centers in history, who won three consecutive championships together.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/14/I have worked with O'Neill and Gasol, but Kobe Bryant is a close relative. I regret that I couldn't play with him/f95985c8cf0743f1b11426a9941f7772.jpg" alt="I have worked with O&#39;Neill and Gasol, but Kobe Bryant is a close relative. I regret that I couldn&#39;t play with him"><br>​<br>Kobe Bryant’s personal heroism reached its peak during his two consecutive scoring championships, but failed to help the team win. He knew he needed to change.<br>The Paul Gasol deal made Popovich very angry. Only the coach of this opponent could understand how it would improve him to give a teammate like Paul Gasol to the top Kobe Bryant. Unfortunately, the Lakers went three finals and won two championships in the next three years.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/14/I have worked with O'Neill and Gasol, but Kobe Bryant is a close relative. I regret that I couldn't play with him/7f6d6f56fe2d44e1b988d39ca950ffae.jpg" alt="I have worked with O&#39;Neill and Gasol, but Kobe Bryant is a close relative. I regret that I couldn&#39;t play with him"><br>​<br>In 2012, the aging Lakers formed Howard, Nash, Gasol and Kobe’s F4 combination, but it seems that every time the Lakers’F4 ended badly. In 2004, the final final of the F4 was bitter. In 12 years, the final of the F4 was Kobe’s Achilles tendon rupture.<br>But among so many teammates, whether good or bad, whether they are in harmony with each other or in contradiction with each other, Kobe may not have some regrets. In his interview after retirement, Kobe himself talked about one thing of that year and the original possibility that he regretted not being able to work together in that year. Chris Paul, his teammate.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/14/I have worked with O'Neill and Gasol, but Kobe Bryant is a close relative. I regret that I couldn't play with him/641af1ced3bf427690567031d56762f2.jpg" alt="I have worked with O&#39;Neill and Gasol, but Kobe Bryant is a close relative. I regret that I couldn&#39;t play with him"><br>​<br>At that time, Paul was also the synonym of the first point guard in the league. Although Kobe was 33 years old at that time, his peak tail still entered the League for a while. No one dared to underestimate Kobe before he was injured.<br>Such a super backcourt combination would have been a foregone conclusion. After knowing the deal, Paul began to communicate with Kobe about what happened after they became teammates. Then the deal was intervened by the league and quickly rejected.<br>At that time, the Hornets were entrusted by the league, so there was no way to do anything about it. The deal that had already been finalized was still blown up. The combination of Kobe and Paul could only exist in people’s imagination forever.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/14/I have worked with O'Neill and Gasol, but Kobe Bryant is a close relative. I regret that I couldn't play with him/0098c03359114b8ead0daebbea43c7af.jpg" alt="I have worked with O&#39;Neill and Gasol, but Kobe Bryant is a close relative. I regret that I couldn&#39;t play with him"><br>​<br>“Crazy, exciting,” Paul told reporters after knowing the progress of the deal. “We talked about everything that might have been a teammate, and in the blink of an eye, the deal went off.”<br>If this super-backcourt combination can be achieved, perhaps the Lakers’fate will not be as miserable as that after 2012, or even younger Paul to help Kobe relieve the pressure, Kobe may not have suffered that Achilles tendon injury.<br>“Everything will be very, very, very different,” Bryant used three “very” in a row, “because we’re probably the most aggressive people you’ve ever seen in the league.”<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/14/I have worked with O'Neill and Gasol, but Kobe Bryant is a close relative. I regret that I couldn't play with him/010bf85ff7984cdcb99d420c50bef0aa.jpg" alt="I have worked with O&#39;Neill and Gasol, but Kobe Bryant is a close relative. I regret that I couldn&#39;t play with him"><br>​<br>They used to be Olympic teammates and have been paired up several times on the All-Star Game. They are both one of the most ambitious players in the league. They are both paranoid about winning.<br>In fact, in his later years, Paul and Harden have been able to compete with the top warriors, so that the Warriors have encountered the greatest crisis in recent years. Who can imagine the peak of Paul without injury attack, and with mature Kobe, what would be a wonderful scene?</p>

    <title>In depth analysis 12 minutes dream back to the top, 9 rounds reverse spurs, he became the key sir</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>From a 19 point lead to a final equaliser, the Lakers won against the Spurs in the fourth quarter, but it wasn’t easy to win. James and bushmei didn’t play very well at the end of the game. They sent out 5 mistakes and 6 mistakes respectively.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/06/In depth analysis 12 minutes dream back to the top, 9 rounds reverse spurs, he became the key sir/d877dc6a5e7d41d689983c32356aaf9b.jpg" alt="In depth analysis 12 minutes dream back to the top, 9 rounds reverse spurs, he became the key sir"><br>James played 11 minutes in the fourth quarter of the game. He got 5 points, 2 rebounds and 3 assists in 6-for-1 shots. Several times he wanted to hammer the set tone through the three-point shot. But in this quarter, all the three-point shots were shot. In the whole game, he shot 6-for-0 shots, and only 10-for-5 free throws. It can be said that although James got three doubles today, he would not be black or spurted, but if James’s regular water was used Ping to measure, in fact, playing is not very good, if no one else to stand up, all rely on him, then the Lakers game will be reversed, kneeling.<br>Bushmei played 7 minutes in the fourth quarter, 3-for-1, 4 points and 2 rebounds. From the perspective of the Lakers’ tactics, the key moment is usually the rotation singles between James and bushmei. In the last game against lone ranger, in the extra time game, the Lakers broke dongqiqi through the “Errenzhuan” between James and bushmei. But this game is not so simple. The final effect is not obvious, because as long as the thick eyebrow turns inside, it will be caught. The ability of the thick eyebrow to get out of the ball is not as top-level as James. It will be caught in a narrow range, and there is a great chance of mistakes.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/06/In depth analysis 12 minutes dream back to the top, 9 rounds reverse spurs, he became the key sir/53d122e9721f4a50bd8a789115c25f3c.jpg" alt="In depth analysis 12 minutes dream back to the top, 9 rounds reverse spurs, he became the key sir"><br>Fortunately, the Lakers have thighs. Howard doesn’t mean that he came out and became the Savior. He just plays as usual. Don’t say that he has a high enthusiasm in this game. This is a wrong statement, because he has such a high enthusiasm in every game. He is trying to protect the rebounds in every game. He is trying to do a good job in the defense of the interior line and his own staff At the same time, when we rotate the ball on the court, we even give the ball to pop, Bradley and others to direct how to rotate the ball. After all, it’s a player full of honors. After all, it’s a player who has played in the finals. Howard has more experience than most of the Lakers.<br>Howard played 12 minutes in the last quarter, 5-for-5, got 10 points, 6 rebounds, 2 blocks, plus or minus 2. Although he only helped the Lakers win 2 points, but without Howard, if Howard was replaced by McGrady or Kuzma, the Lakers would not only win 2 points, maybe lose 20 points, because both James and bushbrow are dumb. Is it up to McGrady and Kuzma Is ZMA aggressive at both ends of attack and defense?<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/06/In depth analysis 12 minutes dream back to the top, 9 rounds reverse spurs, he became the key sir/ab22b621788443e09a30f9be72f8bd85.jpg" alt="In depth analysis 12 minutes dream back to the top, 9 rounds reverse spurs, he became the key sir"><br>Let’s sort out what Howard did in the last 12 minutes to help the Lakers.<br>In 11 minutes and 45 seconds, the Spurs played in the first round, and mills and center borrtel played the pick and roll. When the defense changed to Howard, Howard got a big hand. Mills didn’t dare to step inside, but wanted to pass the ball back to bolt. But Howard obviously blocked Mills’s vision, and the ball directly reached James. Yes, James “picked up” a snatch.<br>In 9:50, Howard and pop play the pick and roll. Pop doesn’t have a chance. The ball comes to Caruso’s hand. With 10 seconds left, Caruso passes the ball to Howard at the low post. This is the first time for Howard in this game. It’s also one of the few calls for the ball this season. With his back to borrtel, Howard turns around and puts the ball in easily, helping the Lakers to stabilize the 7 points. Advantages.<br>Nine minutes and 20 seconds, Howard faced Mills’s breakthrough. With a big hand, mills was confused. The ball went out and the Spurs made a mistake.<br>In 7:50, Howard and Bradley hit the pick and roll. The latter held the ball and went inside. The former went down quickly, and the two finished an air relay. James took gailla out, and the Spurs left the inside to block Bradley’s bolt.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/06/In depth analysis 12 minutes dream back to the top, 9 rounds reverse spurs, he became the key sir/78444611d2034e74a685eb035afca267.jpg" alt="In depth analysis 12 minutes dream back to the top, 9 rounds reverse spurs, he became the key sir"><br>In 6:58, Howard and Bradley played the pick and roll. This time, bolt sealed it. Although Bradley didn’t make the shot, Howard grabbed the rebounds in the front court and finished the dunk. There are four people in the Spurs’ internal line, and no one can stop Howard, who is already in a good position.<br>In 5:30, James didn’t play against Aldridge’s defense. He stopped the ball outside the three-point line. Howard wanted to make an answer himself, but he received James’s pass from the deep inside of the penalty area. He saw bolt in front of him. He swayed for a while, played the ball up to 2 + 1, and extended the difference to 4 points. The free throw didn’t go in, but he grabbed the front rebounds. Later, James did not give the ball to drozan’s thick eyebrow defense, but in front of their own singles defender - or bolt! A foul was committed.<br>Three minutes and 48 seconds, the two sides tied, pop didn’t score three points, standing under the basket four Spurs players are ready to receive rebounds, when all the Lakers players are retreating, Howard is still fighting in place, the Spurs hit the ball out of the bottom line this time, it’s Howard’s credit, help the Lakers win more ball rights, pop hit the mid shot.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/06/In depth analysis 12 minutes dream back to the top, 9 rounds reverse spurs, he became the key sir/885e76f675544d0b8ca2efbe703f8755.jpg" alt="In depth analysis 12 minutes dream back to the top, 9 rounds reverse spurs, he became the key sir"><br>2:50, James missed the shot, Howard from the free throw line to the front rebounds to make up the ball. In 1:50, Howard slammed Murray’s layup, and James got the ball and hit back for a foul. In 1:05, guy took the ball to fight back, Howard retreated to the border, took out the ball with a big hand, guy knocked the ball out of the baseline, Lakers ball right. So far, the Spurs are gone, and the Lakers are in control.<br>In the last 12 minutes, almost every round is the key ball. Howard has made great contributions in the above nine rounds, either scoring, defending successfully, or winning the ball for the Lakers. Howard’s top defensive ability and a dedicated defensive attitude are the most fundamental reasons for the Lakers to win the game.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/06/In depth analysis 12 minutes dream back to the top, 9 rounds reverse spurs, he became the key sir/a3b232920f5046df8aaecc37ce9e600d.jpg" alt="In depth analysis 12 minutes dream back to the top, 9 rounds reverse spurs, he became the key sir"><br>The whole game was played for 20 minutes, the first game didn’t let go, the first three games played for 8 minutes, the last game was ordered to play for 12 minutes, which is the same as the last game, and the effect of Howard is also very similar, because Howard changed the defense of the Lakers, so the game changed.<br>Howard is the only man in the Lakers who can decide the game without scoring!</p>

    <title>Is not Jordan the top scorer in the playoff history Four of the top five stars are from the Lakers</title>
    <url>/2019/08/10/Is%20not%20Jordan%20the%20top%20scorer%20in%20the%20playoff%20history%20Four%20of%20the%20top%20five%20stars%20are%20from%20the%20Lakers/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/10/Is not Jordan the top scorer in the playoff history Four of the top five stars are from the Lakers/edc3e26dd66a4b8aa3bfa28f9678715d.jpg" alt="Is not Jordan the top scorer in the playoff history Four of the top five stars are from the Lakers"><br>​<br>There are not many players in the NBA who have not played in the playoffs, but they are not without them. In fact, one of the previous examples is very prominent, that is, Corsins before injury. Cosins joined the league in 2010, first playing for the Kings, but failed to lead the team into the playoffs for eight years.<br>Although Cosins has strong personal ability, he still can’t play in the playoffs. Only 8 of the 15 teams can enter the playoffs. Under the jungle, this is also a very competitive thing, let alone in the more competitive West.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/10/Is not Jordan the top scorer in the playoff history Four of the top five stars are from the Lakers/3bf385e7ec6d44aa90abbcb16b3c9068.jpg" alt="Is not Jordan the top scorer in the playoff history Four of the top five stars are from the Lakers"><br>​<br>Originally in the 2017-18 season, Cosins was able to enter the playoffs without any accident, but he suffered a serious Achilles tendon injury. After that, he was not so happy in the Warriors’playoff trip.<br>Cosins is only an example of course, in fact, the stars do not say to enter the finals, the difficulty of entering the playoffs is not so great, but to enter the playoffs for a long time, that is the absolute ability to reflect. And the first test of star standards, often is the results, can lead the team to win the star, is the real superstar, and victory usually means the ticket to the playoffs.<br>So, in the history of the NBA, the total ranking of playoff scoring should also be a reference to the success of the stars.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/10/Is not Jordan the top scorer in the playoff history Four of the top five stars are from the Lakers/ab14b52982ab43e3a518847561d207a6.jpg" alt="Is not Jordan the top scorer in the playoff history Four of the top five stars are from the Lakers"><br>​<br>We all know that Jordan is probably the most dazzling star in the history of the NBA, but in fact the first place in the history of the NBA playoffs is not Jordan. Jordan has been surpassed by one person several years ago, only ranking second in history, and the surpassing person is LeBron James.<br>At the same time, James is the only player in active service who can reach the top 10 in total playoff scores.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/10/Is not Jordan the top scorer in the playoff history Four of the top five stars are from the Lakers/03b946d98655446dbf1a882063fe6f16.jpg" alt="Is not Jordan the top scorer in the playoff history Four of the top five stars are from the Lakers"><br>​<br>So far, James’s playoff total score has already reached 6911 points, ranking first in NBA history, exceeding Jordan’s second place by nearly 1000 points. According to the development of the Lakers today, James’s playoff score may continue to rise. After James retires, this playoff total score will also become him. The hardest to break in the record book.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/10/Is not Jordan the top scorer in the playoff history Four of the top five stars are from the Lakers/6081907d35ff428f9d9989bed42a3194.jpg" alt="Is not Jordan the top scorer in the playoff history Four of the top five stars are from the Lakers"><br>​<br>Jordan, the second-place player, scored 5,987 points, but in fact, Jordan’s 15-year career, excluding the rookie season and the last two farewell seasons, all entered the playoffs, and then averaged 33.4 points in the first playoff season, ranking second in the playoff history.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/10/Is not Jordan the top scorer in the playoff history Four of the top five stars are from the Lakers/31685c90e3b04882bb7ef4d1a9f11f6c.jpg" alt="Is not Jordan the top scorer in the playoff history Four of the top five stars are from the Lakers"><br>​<br>The third place is Jabbar’s 5762 points. Jabbar has also been a great figure in his career for 20 years. His total score in the regular season is still the highest in history, and his third place in the playoffs is not uncommon.<br>The fourth place is Kobe Bryant, with a total score of 5640. Kobe’s 220 playoff appearances are also the sixth place in history, with an average score of 10. But considering Kobe’s role as a substitute in his early career and his injuries in his later career, maybe he can do better!<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/10/Is not Jordan the top scorer in the playoff history Four of the top five stars are from the Lakers/e1b9ec52887d4894a1f3a3404f7d0a60.jpg" alt="Is not Jordan the top scorer in the playoff history Four of the top five stars are from the Lakers"><br>​<br>The fifth place was O’Neill, who scored 5,250 points. It’s interesting that Bryant still has to put pressure on his old opponent and old friend in this matter.<br>Duncan, the sixth place, 5,172 points. Duncan’s existence is the absolute dependence of the Spurs dynasty. The Ivy League has stacked Duncan in this position for more than 20 years.<br>The seventh place was Karl Malone, who scored 4761 points in the playoffs, the eighth was Logo, who scored 4457 points, and the ninth was Tony Parker, who scored 4045 points in the GDP portfolio of the Spurs.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/10/Is not Jordan the top scorer in the playoff history Four of the top five stars are from the Lakers/4772962f73664cbe9c006bc30527b28d.jpg" alt="Is not Jordan the top scorer in the playoff history Four of the top five stars are from the Lakers"><br>​<br>Durant is another superstar in the top ten in active service. In fact, Death is only two points away from Parker. Waiting for Durant to return from injury, it is not difficult for him to move up his ranking.</p>

Who was the first/9938e5092a3249588a7bcdf400ae4e26.jpg" alt="How hard is 40 + in the Finals Kurikobe was second only once and James was second only seven times. Who was the first"><br>​<br>This year’s finals, the Warriors against the Raptors G3, the Warriors Clay because of injuries and sickness arranged by the team rest, has been absent Major General Warriors face such a dilemma, can only hope in their core, Curie can make a big difference.<br>In that game, Curie was obviously different from his usual way of playing in recent years. The Warriors’offensive space has become worse and worse in recent seasons. Starting in a Gothic team, the three-point dream has declined, and cousin’s condition is unstable. Under the premise, the Warriors have only one strong offensive point, Stephen Curie.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/05/How hard is 40 + in the Finals Kurikobe was second only once and James was second only seven times. Who was the first/f3e5cd6ab08c4ce5b6a7d53085b10939.jpg" alt="How hard is 40 + in the Finals Kurikobe was second only once and James was second only seven times. Who was the first"><br>​<br>Curie certainly did not live up to expectations. He did his best to help the team throughout the game, and finally scored 47 points, which was his highest point in the playoffs, but it was still not enough to help the team win.<br>Of course, this is also the first 40 + in five Finals of Curie’s career. In the age of small balls with such an open attack rhythm, Curie, whose three-point attack is the representative way, has only got one 40 + in the Finals, which is difficult to imagine.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/05/How hard is 40 + in the Finals Kurikobe was second only once and James was second only seven times. Who was the first/9adeb5c3b34b4673a4d512a495b4046a.jpg" alt="How hard is 40 + in the Finals Kurikobe was second only once and James was second only seven times. Who was the first"><br>​<br>In fact, throughout the history of the NBA, since the free statistics, the Finals 40 + only appeared 58 times.<br>We all know that Kobe Bryant is a famous super scorer in history, but in seven finals of his career, Kobe Bryant only got 40 +, equal to Stephen Cooley.<br>Kobe Bryant made seven finals and five championships in his career, but he only scored 40 points in the G1 against Magic in the 2009 Finals, which was the only 40 + in his career.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/05/How hard is 40 + in the Finals Kurikobe was second only once and James was second only seven times. Who was the first/dd0de857824a4d09ae9e5bc59c6e76e2.jpg" alt="How hard is 40 + in the Finals Kurikobe was second only once and James was second only seven times. Who was the first"><br>​<br>In that game, Kobe Bryant scored 16 of 34 shots, 8 free throws, 8 free throws, 40 shots, and 8 rebounds, 8 assists, 2 blocked shots. The high score and other data are quite comprehensive in Kobe Bryant, which usually means that the Lakers will win a big victory.<br>The Lakers eventually scored a 100-75 victory over Magic, and the Lakers won the championship 4-1.<br>It’s not disgraceful that there is only one 40 + in the finals, and many great gods in history have only one, such as Iverson, Durant, Julius Owen, Barkley, Jabbar and even Chamberlain, the basketball emperor.<br>More than two players have many horror records, such as Elgin Baylor, who has 40 + points in four finals, and keeps a record of 61 points in a single finals game.<br>For example, Rick Barry, who scored 40 + three times in the finals, was the first one in the history of the finals.<br>For example, O’Neill, who won five 40 + finals, and O’Neill, who won five 40 + finals in three consecutive championships, had a strong dominance.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/05/How hard is 40 + in the Finals Kurikobe was second only once and James was second only seven times. Who was the first/55471e60287242aa8eeae35a091bada1.jpg" alt="How hard is 40 + in the Finals Kurikobe was second only once and James was second only seven times. Who was the first"><br>​<br>For example, Michael Jordan, who won 40 + points six times in the Finals, has an average score of 40 + in the single-round Finals. Nobody can break the record so far. It is even more desirable to win 6 Championships and FMVP in the Finals.<br>LeBron James, a terror figure who has made eight consecutive finals, has more 40 + times than Jordan in the finals, seven times altogether. Coincidentally, these seven times all appeared in the finals of the opposing warriors.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/05/How hard is 40 + in the Finals Kurikobe was second only once and James was second only seven times.

Who was the first"><br>​<br>But such James can only be ranked second, the first in the history of this data, is the Finals 10 times 40 + Jerry West, NBA LOGO men.<br>History is 58 times, he alone accounted for 10 times, this proportion is terrible, but LOGO man is most praised for his defeat FMVP, the only history, during the finals, his scores were 53 points, 41 points, 24 points, 39 points, 26 points, 42 points, and grabbed 7 points, 42 points, 13 baskets and 12 assists super triple double.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/05/How hard is 40 + in the Finals Kurikobe was second only once and James was second only seven times.

    <content><![CDATA[<p>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/15/It's all about interests! Talking about Durant in pursuit of his dream proves that he really lives thoroughly/39b6eab1564a480899e3cd8fecef75e8.jpg" alt="It&#39;s all about interests! Talking about Durant in pursuit of his dream proves that he really lives thoroughly"><br>​<br>Now, more than a month and a half has passed since Durant left the selection basket for the Warriors; 65 days have passed since Kevin Durant broke his Achilles tendon after forcibly returning from G5 in the Finals; and more than half a year has passed since the quarrel between KD and Dreaming Green last November, and the Warriors are doing their best. Now, although the core is still there, it is almost a completely different team from last season, and Kevin Durant chose the Nets after he was injured and went to New York.<br>At this point, Dream Chasing Green talked about Durant again in an interview with ESPN, and we can easily guess that the topic around Durant should continue to linger around Dream Chasing for a long time.<br>In fact, Durant also received an interview with Chris Haynes. Of course, he was also asked about dream pursuit. There was something to say about their answers.<br>When Durant talked about the nonsense of pursuing dreams, he just said, “Damn it! I’m tired of talking about it. We’re all adults and professional players. We all understand what this is like… The only difference between me and my former teammates is that I changed different jerseys and nothing else will change.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/15/It's all about interests! Talking about Durant in pursuit of his dream proves that he really lives thoroughly/eea0475a9c644da1964c955e4081c638.jpg" alt="It&#39;s all about interests! Talking about Durant in pursuit of his dream proves that he really lives thoroughly"><br>​<br>Or let’s take a look at today’s version of Dream Pursuit.<br>“I had a conversation with Durant this summer. In fact, we just talked yesterday,” Chasing Dream said. “He’s my brother. If someone told me three years ago that he would join the Warriors, win two championships and reach the finals three times in a row, would you accept that? I’m sure I’ll be happy. It’s a successful experience.<br>The reporter also asked if Dreamchase had ever known the decision to leave the Warrior in advance from Durant.<br>“I know Durant’s time to go to the basket is the same as everybody else’s. It should have been like this. He doesn’t have to tell me before he tells everyone that this is our private life.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/15/It's all about interests! Talking about Durant in pursuit of his dream proves that he really lives thoroughly/c4648121aed44fd68299fc031507cc00.jpg" alt="It&#39;s all about interests! Talking about Durant in pursuit of his dream proves that he really lives thoroughly"><br>​<br>After the storm, until now, Durant went to the basket. Even though he suffered from a broken Achilles tendon, which could almost destroy professional athletes, he still got a four-year top-salary contract.<br>Chasing Dream did not choose to enter the free market one year or next, but renewed the contract with Warriors in advance this year, which seems to cost Chasing Dream. But in fact, it is also the most salary he can get at present. Five years, 118 million yuan, is reasonable and appropriate.<br>As a result, Durant has gone to a new team, and the recovery of injuries may be quicker under the advanced medical conditions of the Nets. As long as he stays healthy, the Nets will still be his team, instead of hearing rumors from the Warriors, even though there is no problem between Kury and Durant.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/15/It's all about interests! Talking about Durant in pursuit of his dream proves that he really lives thoroughly/a05efecfd6df4715844e92f175ce403b.jpg" alt="It&#39;s all about interests! Talking about Durant in pursuit of his dream proves that he really lives thoroughly"><br>​<br>Dream-chasing got a big contract as he wished. His first big contract in his career, when the five-year and 85 million-page contract was finalized, Dream-chasing and his mother’s video, Dream-chasing mother was very happy when she heard the news of dream-chasing contract renewal.<br>Dreaming about family hardships in the past has made the contract more meaningful, and their value for money is different from that of a superstar like Durant.<br>Whether it was such a consideration that the dream chaser finally made the decision of the conflict is unknown, but as a result, the warriors started a new journey and Durant started a new journey. If Durant was not injured, this may be an acceptable situation for everyone.<br>As Durant said, we are all professional players, professional players for their own best interests, this is the right thing to do.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/15/It's all about interests! Talking about Durant in pursuit of his dream proves that he really lives thoroughly/c376c18eb010444cb75ef08992c263ae.jpg" alt="It&#39;s all about interests! Talking about Durant in pursuit of his dream proves that he really lives thoroughly"><br>​<br>But people didn’t realize that in Durant’s first season with the Warriors, there was no follow-up to their quarrel. Even after the quarrel, they slept in the same room, and then they made up.<br>Time can change a lot.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/15/It's all about interests! Talking about Durant in pursuit of his dream proves that he really lives thoroughly/fbb6b81c30684cba8c562c6c623f8768.jpg" alt="It&#39;s all about interests! Talking about Durant in pursuit of his dream proves that he really lives thoroughly"><br>​<br>“Everyone pays attention to me, saying I’m a fool, arguing with Cole, arguing with my teammates, banning the finals, and banning the Durant clash, that’s probably the most clicked content,” this quote in the Dream Pursuit interview was thorough and rational. “But no one wants to know the true content, no one cares about dream chasing is an outstanding and intelligent player, dream chasing is a player who really cares about coaches and teammates, and dream chasing is a person who really cares about winning. Nobody cares about it, because it’s not interesting, and what everyone wants to see is that the Golden State Warriors have tasted defeat.</p>

What’s more, his efficiency is worth mentioning. This is the data he averaged 27.3 minutes per game. In addition, his shooting percentage is the second highest in his career, 48.2%, and his three-point shooting rate is a career high of 37%, far higher than the career average of 30. 4%.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/22/Is the youngest MVP ever underestimated when the initial capability of NBA2K20 is less than that of the newcomers to the league/7b0d5ecf214a4a9e83e26a9829a15c87.jpg" alt="Is the youngest MVP ever underestimated when the initial capability of NBA2K20 is less than that of the newcomers to the league"><br>​<br>With an average of 27 minutes per game, 18 points have been contributed efficiently, which is the starting level or higher than the starting requirement of each team. Such a point guard is acceptable to any team, but such a player, such Derek Ross, has only scored 80 points out of the 2K20 published ability value.<br>Meanwhile, this year’s top rookie Zion scored 81 on the 2K20, surpassing Derek Ross.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/22/Is the youngest MVP ever underestimated when the initial capability of NBA2K20 is less than that of the newcomers to the league/d4c265722b8046728e2c269c6bf77246.jpg" alt="Is the youngest MVP ever underestimated when the initial capability of NBA2K20 is less than that of the newcomers to the league"><br>​<br>Last season’s rookie season, Terry Yang, who performed well, has risen from 77 in 2K19 to 85. Last season, although Terry Yang averaged 19.1 points per game and had 8.1 assists, his shooting percentage was only 41.8%. This is certainly acceptable for a rookie who entered the NBA in his first year, but averaged 19.1 points per game. Scores are still accumulated through 15.5 shots per game.<br>In contrast, Rose averaged 14.8 shots per game, but the shooting rate was significantly better, that is, in the three-point point, Rose’s 37% shooting rate was also better than Trey-Young’s 32.4%. ​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/22/Is the youngest MVP ever underestimated when the initial capability of NBA2K20 is less than that of the newcomers to the league/5a612f97cea04329a84cf0407c76b3e6.jpg" alt="Is the youngest MVP ever underestimated when the initial capability of NBA2K20 is less than that of the newcomers to the league"><br>​<br>Of course, for Ross, it may be more official to take age and physical condition into account, but the ability value of 80 is still too disrespectful for the youngest MVP of the former NBA.<br>Compared with Trey Yang, it is not necessarily to highlight Rosebury Yang Qiang. What Trey Yang’s rookie season shows is surprising enough. Especially his passing skills have definitely met the requirements of NBA level.<br>But the ability value of Trey-Yang 85 is not too difficult for Ross, who is more efficient, to get 82 to 83, even if it is not equal to that of Trey-Yang.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/22/Is the youngest MVP ever underestimated when the initial capability of NBA2K20 is less than that of the newcomers to the league/0d6bdf2ee47548459ba8bffd17a2045f.jpg" alt="Is the youngest MVP ever underestimated when the initial capability of NBA2K20 is less than that of the newcomers to the league"><br>​<br>On this point, in fact, look at Lillard’s view on the ranking of players’ability value.<br>In an interview with The Athletic, Lillard talked about the player’s ability. His own ability in the 2K20 is 92, ranking ninth in the NBA.<br>“No problem. I never really cared. I don’t understand why players get angry about their 2K abilities. I mean, many of the people involved in developing this game may not even shoot.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/22/Is the youngest MVP ever underestimated when the initial capability of NBA2K20 is less than that of the newcomers to the league/5c69507977864f67955218c0eb164679.jpg" alt="Is the youngest MVP ever underestimated when the initial capability of NBA2K20 is less than that of the newcomers to the league"><br>​<br>In fact, Lillard’s evaluation is reasonable. Developing games takes into account the content of the NBA, but more from the perspective of a game, it is foolish to let such developers characterize NBA players and use so-called ability values to delimit the boundaries of an NBA-level player.<br>The NBA players are the ones who don’t need to worry or worry about it, but on the contrary, because most of the players in the League love this game, they naturally care about their ability value, which brings a wave.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/22/Is the youngest MVP ever underestimated when the initial capability of NBA2K20 is less than that of the newcomers to the league/d09a07db5a6944e08b9e92df9dc1518b.jpg" alt="Is the youngest MVP ever underestimated when the initial capability of NBA2K20 is less than that of the newcomers to the league"><br>​<br>However, among these players, Derek Ross, who once shocked the league, is now a sensual star who has broken cocoons into butterflies for the second time. Derek Ross, who once inspired and touched millions of people, is probably the most unaffected by these trends at present. Member.<br>Ross did everything he could in the Timberwolves last season. The leader of the dressing room, the commander on the court, could take over the game at the critical moment. He also played a highly efficient game, which was rare in his career, to get out of the shadow of injury.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/22/Is the youngest MVP ever underestimated when the initial capability of NBA2K20 is less than that of the newcomers to the league/0bb84af6f03443a6973e42bb5b8039af.jpg" alt="Is the youngest MVP ever underestimated when the initial capability of NBA2K20 is less than that of the newcomers to the league"><br>​<br>The post-match interview that scored 50 points turned out to be one of the few touching scenes of last season. Ross, who was reborn from bathing, came to the automobile city in summer, came to the piston and the twin towers. Their collocation made Ross more expectant in the new season.<br>The sun will rise again tomorrow, and the rose will bloom again.<br>Tomorrow the sun is still shining, and the roses will blossom again.</p>

    <title>It&#39;s too bad, isn&#39;t it 33 + 5 + 9 + 2 + 7 in 39 minutes, and he was killed in the last four minutes</title>
    <url>/2019/11/04/It&#39;s%20too%20bad,%20isn&#39;t%20it%2033%20+%205%20+%209%20+%202%20+%207%20in%2039%20minutes,%20and%20he%20was%20killed%20in%20the%20last%20four%20minutes/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>With about five minutes left in the game, the live video shows that the MVP of the game is Lillard, with 33 points and 8 out of 11 three points. In theory, the Blazers are 8 points ahead, with 5 minutes left in the game time. There is no sense of momentum on the 76ers’ side, while on the Blazers’ side, three shot Lillard, mccullham and hood can all provide enough energy. This MVP has no problems, but who knows it has been beaten!<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/04/It's too bad, isn't it 33 + 5 + 9 + 2 + 7 in 39 minutes, and he was killed in the last four minutes/2ffc571188004c1980b6472316a43f92.jpg" alt="It&#39;s too bad, isn&#39;t it 33 + 5 + 9 + 2 + 7 in 39 minutes, and he was killed in the last four minutes"><br>When Lillard scored three-point goal in 5:05 seconds at the end of the game, he had already got 33 points, but he played another five minutes, until the end of the game, or 33 points, and he didn’t get one point in the last five minutes. In any case, no matter how efficient Lillard’s game was, as a star at home, he was more or less responsible.<br>In the whole game, Lillard played 39 minutes, 11 of 16 shots, 8 of 3-pointer 11, 3 of 3 free throws, got 33 points, 5 rebounds, 9 assists, 2 steals, and sent out 7 mistakes. Although the Blazers lost, his positive and negative value was + 7. If the Blazers win, Lillard is a worthy MVP, not only the data is good, but also the Blazers are under Lillard’s leadership to pull the score to more than 20 points. When the 76ers in the fourth quarter chase the points, Lillard also uses the far-reaching key three points to stabilize the situation.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/04/It's too bad, isn't it 33 + 5 + 9 + 2 + 7 in 39 minutes, and he was killed in the last four minutes/eafd2f94aaa44433bda4079f9b3fdc02.jpg" alt="It&#39;s too bad, isn&#39;t it 33 + 5 + 9 + 2 + 7 in 39 minutes, and he was killed in the last four minutes"><br>In the fourth quarter, Lillard played for 10 minutes, three-point, three shot, three shot, nine points, one rebounds and three assists. In the first five minutes, Lillard three-point shot three times, in the last five minutes, Lillard did not get a point? What happened?<br>In the previous period of time, the 76 man defense McCollam and Lillard adopted the strategy of releasing their shots. The Pioneer Center mentioned that after the three-point line was removed, the ball holder would be able to have a big space, because the 76 man center could not come up at all, and was still waiting for the rebound in the restricted area. But starting with Lillard’s last three-point goal, the 76ers changed their defensive strategy, replacing o’aquin with hofford.<br>In the first round of holding the ball, it was the center’s pick and break. At Horford, he grabbed the bag and caught Lillard. Lillard chose to give the ball to betsmore, who made a mistake in passing and was scored a three-point goal by Richardson.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/04/It's too bad, isn't it 33 + 5 + 9 + 2 + 7 in 39 minutes, and he was killed in the last four minutes/1e59391fc5ee4ad9a8a1106dda40ba91.jpg" alt="It&#39;s too bad, isn&#39;t it 33 + 5 + 9 + 2 + 7 in 39 minutes, and he was killed in the last four minutes"><br>In the second holding round, McCollam was ready to play pick and roll with Lillard. Houdford followed McCollam to the outside of the three-point line. The card position was very fierce, and even was blown foul. Although it was blown foul, it can be seen that the defense strategy and defense enthusiasm of 76 people have changed a lot.<br>In the third round, the Blazers arranged three people to cover Lillard outside the three-point line, but in exchange, the 76ers and three people, including Lillard, Richardson, hofford and Simmons, surrounded Lillard, and finally were robbed. Simmons scored 2 points in the fast break.<br>In the next round, Lillard stopped holding the ball and stood on his knees at a 45 degree corner to watch his teammates play. At this time, McCollam was ready to take over the game, but the defense was very close to the outside, so he was not allowed to catch the ball. In the end, mozbell forced his shot against hofford’s defense and lost it.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/04/It's too bad, isn't it 33 + 5 + 9 + 2 + 7 in 39 minutes, and he was killed in the last four minutes/81c33d9b8be04b4280e0a32a2321caed.jpg" alt="It&#39;s too bad, isn&#39;t it 33 + 5 + 9 + 2 + 7 in 39 minutes, and he was killed in the last four minutes"><br>In the fourth round of holding the ball, Lillard couldn’t stand it. There was no way but for him to hold the ball and play the pioneer with more assurance. This time, it was changed to Harris defense. Lillard seemed a little tired, didn’t change direction quickly, didn’t accelerate suddenly, Harris didn’t lose his position, Lillard didn’t have a chance to shoot, and finally sent out a passing error. Back by hofford a violent deduction, the score will be traced to 1 point left.<br>In the fifth round of holding the ball, Lillard didn’t need to pick and remove this time, but he couldn’t pass Richardson. It can even be said that Lillard didn’t want him. Maybe he was a little tired. He stopped the ball directly at the logo position. By reason of Lillard’s explosive power and speed advantage, this position shouldn’t be forced to stop. Then Lillard passed it to mccollham, and shot against the defense, three points on the iron. Then there was Simmons’s 2-for-2, Simmons’s 10 second quasi kill, and colkmaz’s 2.2 second counter kill.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/04/It's too bad, isn't it 33 + 5 + 9 + 2 + 7 in 39 minutes, and he was killed in the last four minutes/15c930c4c90b45ac9c93549cdbad13e2.jpg" alt="It&#39;s too bad, isn&#39;t it 33 + 5 + 9 + 2 + 7 in 39 minutes, and he was killed in the last four minutes"><br>It can be seen from the last five minutes of these rounds that Lillard is a little tired. He played for 39 minutes. When the 76ers suddenly got on the defensive strength, Lillard obviously felt the pressure. The inner line didn’t break in, the outer line didn’t have a chance to shoot, and the 76ers didn’t give Lillard a chance to play one by one in the wrong position. At last, they dare not play in the face of Richardson. When Lillard was in trouble, mccullham didn’t come out. Hu De, who felt the hottest, left the field because of his injury. He had to give it to bezhmore. In this game, bezhmore played 25 minutes, got 7 points, 6 rebounds, 1 assists, 2 steals, 2 blocks, 2 mistakes, plus or minus - 18, the lowest in the whole game.<br>Lillard is really strong, this has to be admitted, but there is always a reason why he can’t become a superstar, why he can’t reach the finals.</p>

    <title>Jordan averaged 37 points and 27 shots, and Harden averaged 36 points and only 24 shots. What&#39;s the secret</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/11/Jordan averaged 37 points and 27 shots, and Harden averaged 36 points and only 24 shots. What's the secret/34f3ae8ffc8246078490025ea6f68d94.jpg" alt="Jordan averaged 37 points and 27 shots, and Harden averaged 36 points and only 24 shots. What&#39;s the secret"><br>​<br>The definition of super scorer is closely related to the score in words. You can’t say that a scorer can’t even achieve 25 points per game. And super scorer can’t say that without a season of 30 + per game.<br>In fact, there are only 33 players who can break 30 points per season in the whole history of the NBA. In the past 70 years, only 30 pairs of talented people have been found. If we count the data after the amalgamation of the NBA and ABA in 1976, only 18 players have averaged 30 +.<br>Put the upper limit a little higher. In NBA history, players with an average score of more than 35 points per game are also the top figures standing on the spire in the star-studded pyramid. Only six superstars have appeared in 70 years’history. After the combination of NBA and ABA, Michael Jordan is the only one. Kobe Bryant and James Harden for the 2018-19 season last season.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/11/Jordan averaged 37 points and 27 shots, and Harden averaged 36 points and only 24 shots. What's the secret/b82050570cdb4d9fba2103ff09935cc7.jpg" alt="Jordan averaged 37 points and 27 shots, and Harden averaged 36 points and only 24 shots. What&#39;s the secret"><br>​<br>The high score necessarily represents the centralized ball power and the super-high shot, but the high score does not necessarily represent the high score, also has the efficiency is not too good player, under the super-high hand accumulation still failed to hit the amazing score, this is precisely 1976 until now only three big gods completed the season average 35 + difficult. Place.<br>Michael Jordan in 1986-87 was his second full season. After all, at the beginning of the 85-86 season, he suffered a serious injury to his left scaphoid bone and missed 64 games without breath. He did not return until the playoffs, even though Jordan had 63 points in the playoffs that year when God put on Jordan’s 23 jersey. Miracles are also the single-game scoring record of the NBA playoffs, but in the playoffs they were simply swept out by the 3-0 down by the Celtics, the championship team of that year.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/11/Jordan averaged 37 points and 27 shots, and Harden averaged 36 points and only 24 shots. What's the secret/79bd2732f45443ada612d2ee49e32917.jpg" alt="Jordan averaged 37 points and 27 shots, and Harden averaged 36 points and only 24 shots. What&#39;s the secret"><br>​<br>In the second full season of Jordan’s career, the rookie season has been upgraded again by Jordan, who averaged 28 points per game, with a season average of 37.1 points after the 1976 NBA and ABA merger.<br>In the 86-87 season, Jordan averaged 37.1 points per game, 5.2 rebounds and 4.6 assists, 2.9 steals per game and 1.5 blocks per game. Like Kobe’s performance in the 2005-06 season, his personal heroism was almost at its peak.<br>That season, Jordan scored an average of 37.1 points, used 27.8 shots per game, appalling, but in fact, Jordan’s shooting rate of 48.2% is quite good.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/11/Jordan averaged 37 points and 27 shots, and Harden averaged 36 points and only 24 shots. What's the secret/09f40296d4fe4b189ebfd5a71d76a5c8.jpg" alt="Jordan averaged 37 points and 27 shots, and Harden averaged 36 points and only 24 shots. What&#39;s the secret"><br>​<br>27.8 shots, or average shots, Jordan’s shots were terrible enough, but he played 82 games throughout the season, averaging 40 minutes per game. This kind of physical explosion scoring performance is really shocking.<br>In the 2005-06 season, Bryant’s scoring performance was not so good. In fact, the Lakers had a good record of 45-35 in that season. At the beginning of the season, Bryant tried to sacrifice his ball rights for the team, but after seeing the team did not improve, he started to maintain the scoring feast for the whole season regardless.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/11/Jordan averaged 37 points and 27 shots, and Harden averaged 36 points and only 24 shots. What's the secret/16e8bdaf8cb343b4a4f7f18c8ccbdc26.jpg" alt="Jordan averaged 37 points and 27 shots, and Harden averaged 36 points and only 24 shots. What&#39;s the secret"><br>​<br>The modern basketball miracle of 81 points in a single game also appeared in that season. In January and April of two months, Bryant scored more than 40 points in a monthly average, with six 50 + points in a single season. Bryant’s explosive scoring performances still make people fascinated and deeply affect a generation.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/11/Jordan averaged 37 points and 27 shots, and Harden averaged 36 points and only 24 shots. What's the secret/a701ef37fb7b4138a0f4a54e790b2cfe.jpg" alt="Jordan averaged 37 points and 27 shots, and Harden averaged 36 points and only 24 shots. What&#39;s the secret"><br>​<br>Bryant averaged 35.4 points per game in the 2005-06 season, using 27.2 shots per game. At that time, the Lakers had no other people to rely on.<br>But when it comes to the ratio of scoring to shooting, Harden should miss the winning smile, because in today’s basketball trend, Harden seems to perform better.<br>Last season, Harden also played a great season, averaging 36.1 points per game, the only time Jordan has surpassed Kobe Bryant since 1976, and this time he averaged 36.1 points, only used 24.5 shots, which is the most exaggerated place.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/11/Jordan averaged 37 points and 27 shots, and Harden averaged 36 points and only 24 shots. What's the secret/d94cad1a32ac442ea48834a63300a020.jpg" alt="Jordan averaged 37 points and 27 shots, and Harden averaged 36 points and only 24 shots. What&#39;s the secret"><br>​<br>It may be questioned whether Harden’s free throw ability has taken advantage of him, but it is not true. Harden averaged 11 free throws per game last season, which is the highest in his career, but is not as good as Jordan’s 11.9 free throws in the 86-87 season, and Kobe’s 10.2 free throws.<br>In fact, it was his three-point shooting and three-point ratio that really broke out Harden’s score. Harden’s average three-point shooting number was 13.2 times last season. With so many shots, Harden still stabilized his three-point shooting rate to 36.8%, which is a terrible efficiency.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/11/Jordan averaged 37 points and 27 shots, and Harden averaged 36 points and only 24 shots. What's the secret/18802c10aa9d4dda9aace0276b157786.jpg" alt="Jordan averaged 37 points and 27 shots, and Harden averaged 36 points and only 24 shots. What&#39;s the secret"><br>​<br>In any case, three points are one point more than two points, and children can calculate math problems. When three points remain high while still being able to keep high hits, the speed of the score increase is naturally unimaginable, which also gave birth to the great season of Harden.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/12/Jordan has won 10 scoring Championships in his 15-year career.

Who has won the championship in the remaining 5 years"><br>​<br>The legendary experience of Michael Jordan’s career, there are many things to be elaborated on, there is an old saying called, using data to blow Michael Jordan, may be the least innovative blow.<br>But in fact, Jordan’s data are too shocking. He spent only five years in his career, including rookie season and two retirement seasons, and completely conquered the whole NBA, even the whole basketball world. The impact of his existence on people is inconceivable.<br>Average 40 +? Six to the Finals and six to win the championship? Jordan never grabs seven? Three consecutive crowns? Three more consecutive titles after retirement? Five MVPs? 72-10, the first win in history? It’s shocking enough to throw out a single data, but Jordan never lacks such shocks.<br>However, as far as scoring is concerned, the reason why Jordan can be called the best player in NBA history lies in his absolute dominance over scoring.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/12/Jordan has won 10 scoring Championships in his 15-year career. Who has won the championship in the remaining 5 years/64ba6cef8be94aa38be69834b5958a15.jpg" alt="Jordan has won 10 scoring Championships in his 15-year career. Who has won the championship in the remaining 5 years"><br>​<br>Jordan ranked first in the regular season history and first in the playoffs history. Jordan also ranked first in the playoffs history. In Michael Jordan’s 15-year career, Jordan has won 10 Championship trophies.<br>Today’s stars, who are very capable of scoring, are already quite good at winning one scoring champion in their career. Those who have won more than two scoring champions are enough to call them scorers of historical rank. In the era of the same talents in the 1980s and 1990s, Jordan ruled the award and from 1987 to 1993. Jordan scored seven consecutive points, appalling.<br>It is reasonable to say that there are talented people in Jiangshan Dynasty, each leading the way for hundreds of years, but in front of the powerful Jordan, all the top scorers seem to have to come second.<br>This point, we do not get from Jordan scoring king to analyze, after all, this is nothing new, why we from Jordan lost the remaining five scoring champions in 15 years, more highlight his horror.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/12/Jordan has won 10 scoring Championships in his 15-year career.

Who has won the championship in the remaining 5 years"><br>​<br>In the last two years of Jordan’s career, he averaged 22.9 points per game and 20 points per game, which is far from the average level of his career. But in the last two years, Jordan was nearly 40 years old, and even such Jordan scored 51 points per game.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/12/Jordan has won 10 scoring Championships in his 15-year career.

Who has won the championship in the remaining 5 years"><br>​<br>But even Jordan can not withstand the impact of years. In those two seasons, Iverson scored 31.4 points per game in 2001-2002 and McGrady scored 32.1 points per game in 2002-2003. In the 2001-2002 season, Jordan still ranked ninth in the league in average points per game.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/12/Jordan has won 10 scoring Championships in his 15-year career.

Who has won the championship in the remaining 5 years"><br>​<br>Jordan’s rookie season also failed to win the scoring championship, but just entering the first year of the league, Jordan has scored an average of 28.2 points, 6.2 rebounds and 5.3 assists in 82 games, ranking third in the scoring list. This is only Jordan of the rookie season, who scored 32.9 points per game by Bernard King. Win.<br>Jordan failed to win the scoring in the second season of his career, but only 3 games were played at the beginning of the season. Jordan suffered a left foot fracture and was not returned to the court until the end of the season. The scoring king of the season was picked up by Dominic Wilkins. “The essence of human movie” is also a great shooting guard. Average 30.3 points per game in each season. But it was Jordan that season, although the playoffs were swept by the Celtics, the championship team of the season, but played a single playoff highest score of 63 points miracle.<br>Jordan’s shocking scoring performance lasted seven seasons, starting with an average of 37.1 points per game in his third season, until his first three consecutive championships and retirement.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/12/Jordan has won 10 scoring Championships in his 15-year career.

Who has won the championship in the remaining 5 years"><br>​<br>In the short season after his retirement, Jordan played only 17 games. He was in no condition and scored only 26.9 points per game. Of course, he did not win the title. That season’s top scorer was O’Neill, who averaged 29.3 points per game. In fact, Jordan was scored by O’Neill’s Magic team in the playoffs that year. Out of the game.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/12/Jordan has won 10 scoring Championships in his 15-year career.

Shakespeare’s famous saying is that there are a thousand Hamlet in a thousand people’s hearts. It means that people with different opinions and wisdom have different opinions. A thousand people will have a thousand or more ideas about the same thing in their minds.<br>The same example applies in the field of basketball, and the most frequently used place is the vertex PK in the field of basketball, such as who is the most historic in the field of basketball?<br>In most people’s minds, the history of basketball is not even a problem, because Michael Jordan’s name is almost linked to basketball. The most obvious example is a person who may not know basketball at all, but he probably has heard of Michael Jordan’s reputation, which is Jordan’s unique position in the field of basketball.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/24/Jordan won 9 votes for 23 NBA players, James/4a37df5baca445c6803c49556e457b07.jpg" alt="Jordan won 9 votes for 23 NBA players, James"><br>​<br>But in fact, from the basketball player’s point of view, as the world’s top group of basketball players, let them be willing to admit the greatness of others, it is not an easy thing, especially the players who have achieved great achievements in the NBA.<br>Recently, American media have made a statistics and integration, in the eyes of 23 NBA historical celebrities, who is the best Goat in the NBA?<br>First of all, the results are interesting. In the minds of 8-9% of the public, Jordan firmly occupies the best place in history. He only got 10 votes in full reckoning, which may be a more surprising result.<br>The final result is Jordan’s 10 votes, of course, Jordan’s votes are ahead of the others by a large margin, the status of detachment is still revealed;<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/24/Jordan won 9 votes for 23 NBA players, James/8ce1863c06ad41b3a7e1dd2296f6d362.jpg" alt="Jordan won 9 votes for 23 NBA players, James"><br>​<br>Jabbar, the top scorer in NBA history, won 4 votes. Of course, Jabbar’s career is more than “Sky hook”. Six regular season MVPs, five champions, two FMVPs are solid honors.<br>Chamberlain, who got three votes, can be called the “basketball emperor” this kind of overbearing nickname player, naturally has two brushes, and Chamberlain left behind a series of almost unbreakable records, which highlights his historical status;<br>LeBron James was younger than the gods on the list, but he still got two votes. There were old hooligan Jordan, Chamberlain and James in the record book.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/24/Jordan won 9 votes for 23 NBA players, James/0d7683b632b6453e80c0684aca557f87.jpg" alt="Jordan won 9 votes for 23 NBA players, James"><br>​<br>In addition, Russell, the Lord of the Rings, got one vote, Oscar Robertson, the Big O, and Lemon, who most probably never heard of, got one, but it was from Chamberlain.<br>It was Jabbar who chose Big O, and Bob Pettit, a Hall of Fame member, who chose Russell.<br>There were Oscar and Isaiah Thomas voting for James.<br>The three votes for Chamberlain were Pippen, Rick Barry and Ferrezer. Of course, Pippen’s vote was relatively far-fetched.<br>For Jabbar, Marlon, Dr. J, Bill Wharton and George Gwen, the Iceman.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/24/Jordan won 9 votes for 23 NBA players, James/574ce6b1ba37490781192f2cbf037376.jpg" alt="Jordan won 9 votes for 23 NBA players, James"><br>​<br>Jordan’s 10 votes were solid, mostly from his opponents, such as Bird, Magician, Barrick, Elgin Baylor, Bob Cusey, O’Neill, Olajuwon, and the ancient LOGO man Jerry West and Lady Russell.<br>Of course, when it comes to statistics, the media acquiesce in Jordan’s own choices. After all, Jordan has never answered this question positively, but it shows something that he does not admit that others have the best history.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/24/Jordan won 9 votes for 23 NBA players, James/009d7eaf96564b508f0d47a7b1d9a54f.jpg" alt="Jordan won 9 votes for 23 NBA players, James"><br>​<br>As the article begins, a thousand people have a thousand Hamlet in their hearts, let alone in the eyes of these haughty athletes.<br>Without confidence in themselves, they may not be at the top of the NBA pyramid, and they certainly have the right to remain so arrogant.<br>However, we can’t expect them to really cross time and space in the same stadium to win and lose. This kind of confrontation is just like “Guan Gong and Qin Qiong”. It’s reasonable for a fair mother-in-law to say she’s right.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/24/Jordan won 9 votes for 23 NBA players, James/33f4804c2cb2477486df1c6306bb7aa2.jpg" alt="Jordan won 9 votes for 23 NBA players, James"><br>​<br>However, Jordan’s historical position is not exaggerated. From the hard indicators of superstars, the accumulation of six Championships + 5 MVP + 6 FMVPs has made him grow from the talented player who just started his career to the greatest one in history. This is not evaluated by others, but the achievement of Jordan’s birth.</p>

    <title>Kevin Durant, 38 points in the half and 50 points in the whole court, what bicycles do the Warriors need</title>
    <url>/2019/08/17/Kevin%20Durant,%2038%20points%20in%20the%20half%20and%2050%20points%20in%20the%20whole%20court,%20what%20bicycles%20do%20the%20Warriors%20need/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/17/Kevin Durant, 38 points in the half and 50 points in the whole court, what bicycles do the Warriors need/0341cbd2199a41b3891b58ec4cad2b01.jpg" alt="Kevin Durant, 38 points in the half and 50 points in the whole court, what bicycles do the Warriors need"><br>​<br>It was originally a series of games in which both coaches showed their wisdom. At least Rivers and the Clippers tried their best to create problems for the Warriors. Cole or the Warriors also made some adjustments to the Clippers’targeting.<br>But at the end of the series, Durant again disrupted everyone’s layout, including the Clippers, including the Warriors.<br>Durant seems to be showing that what fucking tactics are not tactical and that you can’t win the last game with 45 points? That’s 50 points.<br>Of course, some of the data are just appearances. Let’s see why Durant’s performance in the first three games is so different from that in the last three.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/17/Kevin Durant, 38 points in the half and 50 points in the whole court, what bicycles do the Warriors need/eb776187f3ff4b3f89c95dc3a2c9967e.jpg" alt="Kevin Durant, 38 points in the half and 50 points in the whole court, what bicycles do the Warriors need"><br>​</p>
<h1 id="The-aim-of-the-Clippers’whole-series-and-Durant’s-incomprehension"><a href="#The-aim-of-the-Clippers’whole-series-and-Durant’s-incomprehension" class="headerlink" title="The aim of the Clippers’whole series and Durant’s incomprehension"></a>The aim of the Clippers’whole series and Durant’s incomprehension</h1><p>In the first three games, Rivers’s approach was to target Durant.<br>The arrowhead they sent was Beverly, and it turned out that Beverly’s entanglement was very uncomfortable with Durant, who was not accustomed to this level of confrontation.<br>As a result, Beverly’s struggle in the first two matches was very effective, and he almost offset Durant’s existence at the expense of cashmere.<br>In the first game, Durant fought the whole game and was expelled in the last two. In the second game, Durant scored 21 points from 5-for-8, but he made nine playoff mistakes with the Clippers’defense. At the end of the game, his full departure became the key point for the Warriors to be reversed.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/17/Kevin Durant, 38 points in the half and 50 points in the whole court, what bicycles do the Warriors need/1a7cf037834041519de91b9b35c06916.jpg" alt="Kevin Durant, 38 points in the half and 50 points in the whole court, what bicycles do the Warriors need"><br>​<br>But after Game 3, Durant opened the lid on his offensive end. His anger was so high that no one could stop him.<br>In the last four games, Durant averaged 41.5 points and shot 57.3%, which was horrible.<br>In fact, Durant also scored an average of 35 points, 5.3 rebounds and 5.3 assists in the series with 56.7%, 40% and 94.9% hits.<br>After finding a solution to Beverly’s tussle in Game 3, Rivers quickly adjusted and began writing defensive articles about Curie.<br>Durant’s attacking environment was too comfortable when rival teams began to write about Curie and Clay. His unsolved singles will despair the enemy again and again.<br>Last season’s Western Finals against Tucker, Paul and Ariza all scored an average of 30.4 points per game, defensive resources are obviously not as good as last year’s Rockets Clippers, Kevin Durant is obviously unable to deal with this natural mistake.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/17/Kevin Durant, 38 points in the half and 50 points in the whole court, what bicycles do the Warriors need/efd341c5819342ba82fa5492d44273fa.jpg" alt="Kevin Durant, 38 points in the half and 50 points in the whole court, what bicycles do the Warriors need"><br>​</p>
<h1 id="Durant-of-G6-disrupted-the-deployment-of-both-sides"><a href="#Durant-of-G6-disrupted-the-deployment-of-both-sides" class="headerlink" title="Durant of G6 disrupted the deployment of both sides"></a>Durant of G6 disrupted the deployment of both sides</h1><p>In fact, as Cole was forced to adjust for the first time today, the Warriors were trying to win the game defensively.<br>They swapped in the starting line-up, removed Bogut and took Livingston, considering a counterpoint issue.<br>Clipper launches: Beverly, Alexander, Shamet, Galinari and Jamaco-Green, each of which seems to have a little projective power.<br>Before the Warriors did not adjust, Jamako-Green played very well in the G5, and his three-point outside line actually gave the Warriors some of the first defense.<br>But when the Warriors made adjustments to replace Livingston, they were also able to get on the speed and agility of the Clippers. Because the Clippers are actually a three-guard system, Alexander is more like a swing guard, but he plays more defensively.<br>However, judging from the actual situation in the first and third quarters of the game, the Warriors’starting adjustment actually hurt themselves.<br>Livingston has no outside shooting, Dream-chasing Green all teams will choose to let go of their shooting, the first two points did not shoot, the Clippers can arbitrarily pack the library, find people to defend against Clay and Durant can hold the Warriors attack.<br>Curie’s few opening chances are also affected by this reason. Clay hardly has any mobile phone chances. When the ball stops in Levin’s and dream-pursuing hands, they have to go to Durant.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/17/Kevin Durant, 38 points in the half and 50 points in the whole court, what bicycles do the Warriors need/eb776187f3ff4b3f89c95dc3a2c9967e.jpg" alt="Kevin Durant, 38 points in the half and 50 points in the whole court, what bicycles do the Warriors need"><br>​<br>But the problem is Durant.<br>Durant said in an interview before the game that “the team did not start well”, which means that he knows it is very important to start well against a team like the Clippers. When the team’s offense is targeted, it is necessary for him to stand out as a super singles player.<br>Not only did Durant stand out, but his footsteps shook Staples’entire stadium.<br>In the first quarter, Durant’s mid-shot and his resolute offensive basketball scored 15 points in a single quarter, and the Clippers’performance of 15 points in a single quarter is no wonder. They didn’t do anything about Durant.<br>Durant scored 23 points in the second quarter, the main reason for his outbreak was his three consecutive points.<br>I have to say that when Durant, who is a CIC watchdog, can hit three consecutive points, the Clippers’dump obviously came a little too slowly.<br>Of course, the Clippers only have five players who can play, and they need to be careful about the presence of Curie and Clay, which is not difficult to understand. But they really underestimated Durant’s desire to attack in the half-match.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/17/Kevin Durant, 38 points in the half and 50 points in the whole court, what bicycles do the Warriors need/b60fda31bcd343afb970e7ffc2c5d17c.jpg" alt="Kevin Durant, 38 points in the half and 50 points in the whole court, what bicycles do the Warriors need"><br>​</p>
<h1 id="The-Warriors’defense-is-still-online-mostly-for-Luwe-and-Harrel"><a href="#The-Warriors’defense-is-still-online-mostly-for-Luwe-and-Harrel" class="headerlink" title="The Warriors’defense is still online, mostly for Luwe and Harrel."></a>The Warriors’defense is still online, mostly for Luwe and Harrel.</h1><p>The first adjustment was to put Luni and Luni on the bench and follow Luvi and Harrel up and down together, aiming at Luvi and Harrel.<br>So this game, the serious Warriors, through the defensive restriction of Luwey 21 to 3 shots, Harrell was limited to only 10 points. This is far below the average of their series.<br>When the combination of Luwe and Harrel did not work, it was clear that the Clippers could not rise.<br>Even though their starter Garinali scored a playoff high of 29 points, and Alexander still did a good job of 22+5+6, they were not enough to beat the Warriors.<br>The two lost games are also obvious. If the Warriors can’t disassemble the combination of Louis and Harrel and their blocks, the Warriors will be in a very difficult situation.<br>With the overall level of the Warriors, they can also compete with the Clippers, they have this ability, but two careless losses in Jingzhou let the Warriors understand the postseason defensive attitude required.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/17/Kevin Durant, 38 points in the half and 50 points in the whole court, what bicycles do the Warriors need/d333726e932543e89970873974ad2bc2.jpg" alt="Kevin Durant, 38 points in the half and 50 points in the whole court, what bicycles do the Warriors need"><br>​<br>Dream of today’s four blocks, Clay’s three blocks, Durant’s nail-plate cap against Gallinari, Igodara’s three steals, Clayyigo’s whole game of pressure and stealing when Louis held the ball, and the Warriors’quick organized counter-attack, all these are the Warriors’ response after playing carelessly.<br>Defensive oppression, Durant explosion on the offensive end, Green dispatch, stable output of Curie, even if Clay feels bad, the warriors are enough to win the opponent.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/17/Kevin Durant, 38 points in the half and 50 points in the whole court, what bicycles do the Warriors need/764b4f336d44477e859e8ec68d92ea77.jpg" alt="Kevin Durant, 38 points in the half and 50 points in the whole court, what bicycles do the Warriors need"><br>​<br>There is a Durant who can score 38 points in the playoffs and 50 points in the playoffs. Sometimes strange tactics or rotation can be less. In the key rounds, what bicycles do Warriors and Cole need?</p>

    <title>Lakers key sir! 11 points plus or minus 12 in 6 minutes. He helped James reverse the bull</title>
    <url>/2019/11/04/Lakers%20key%20sir!%2011%20points%20plus%20or%20minus%2012%20in%206%20minutes.%20He%20helped%20James%20reverse%20the%20bull/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Lakers struggled to win their sixth straight win in Chicago, a game James played brilliantly and repeatedly stood up at critical moments to withstand the pressure. When teammates make mistakes and the defense is not focused, it’s him who carries the team by scoring. When the Lakers are nearly 20 points behind, it’s James who helps the team stabilize the situation by hitting the inside line with the most disliked and tired scoring method.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/04/Lakers key sir! 11 points plus or minus 12 in 6 minutes. He helped James reverse the bull/5b6dad8331034f5cb448198320f16955.jpg" alt="Lakers key sir! 11 points plus or minus 12 in 6 minutes. He helped James reverse the bull"><br>However, it’s not James who really beat the score and reversed the bulls. This man was supposed to be bushmei, but bushmei’s performance in this game was a bit bad. He got 15 points and 7 rebounds from 6 of 15 shots in the whole game. He performed well in the defensive end, showing a defensive aggressiveness of the best defensive player level, but he was a little weak in the offensive end. In the first three quarters, he only got 8 points, and his hit rate was very low. He was also plagued by the number of fouls, so in the third quarter At the beginning of the four quarters, he was supposed to lead the substitute on the court, and became a pure substitute team with Kuzma as the core.<br>Kuzma is a key figure in the Lakers’ reversal of the bulls. James is certainly the core element of winning this game. Without his stable play in the first three quarters, the Lakers could not reach the fourth quarter at all, and Kuzma’s play in the fourth quarter became a turning point of the whole game.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/04/Lakers key sir! 11 points plus or minus 12 in 6 minutes. He helped James reverse the bull/1eb0637e3a2840dc8190db7c264eb421.jpg" alt="Lakers key sir! 11 points plus or minus 12 in 6 minutes. He helped James reverse the bull"><br>Like bushmei, Kuzma was in a very bad condition in the first three quarters. Not only was he unable to play on the offensive side, but also he didn’t contribute on the defensive side, and even made low-level mistakes. It may have something to do with his physical recovery and his long absence from the battle, but Vogel didn’t let him go, still trusted him and gave him a chance.<br>Kuzma played the whole game for 21 minutes, 16 shots 7, 15 points 4 rebounds. In the first three quarters of the game, he scored 4 points in 2 of 8 shots, and his three-point touch could not be found all the time. If we have to say some objective reasons, that is, when Kuzma and any one of the two superstars are present at the same time, his self-confidence may be affected. Some of the balls are not very decisive, many of them are facing the defense and shooting, and they are not opportunities at all. But in the pure second line-up, Kuzma was obviously very open. In the fourth quarter, Kuzma played 6 minutes, got 11 points and 2 rebounds from 5 of 8 shots, plus or minus 12 points in a single quarter. Under Kuzma’s leadership, the Lakers surpassed the bulls in a wave of attacks.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/04/Lakers key sir! 11 points plus or minus 12 in 6 minutes. He helped James reverse the bull/cd34041ae43a47e0a8615cf61eef3fcd.jpg" alt="Lakers key sir! 11 points plus or minus 12 in 6 minutes. He helped James reverse the bull"><br>At the beginning of the fourth quarter, Kuzma received Caruso’s pass, which was not a good chance, but Kuzma made it, because if he didn’t make it, other people’s grasp was even less, Kuzma’s self-confidence was very high. Then, through Howard’s cover, he received cook’s pass, shook off the defender, took the ball to the inside, layup and scored. In the third goal, Kuzma received the baseline service with 4 seconds left. Facing the defender, Kuzma decisively chose to break through. After breaking through, no one from the Bulls came to assist the defense, threw and hit and caused a foul.<br>At the beginning of this season, the Lakers played a wave of 16-0 direct game to surpass the score, but there was no James, no eyebrows, the main attack point was Kuzma. In fact, this set of lineup should have worried people, because Kuzma’s hand feel is not good since he came back, other players have not played well in this game, the three strongest 3D players pop, Danny green and Bradley are not in, and the attack efficiency of the Lakers should be the worst.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/04/Lakers key sir! 11 points plus or minus 12 in 6 minutes. He helped James reverse the bull/901c422c6d5a487a8d3a93e8fa0fd887.jpg" alt="Lakers key sir! 11 points plus or minus 12 in 6 minutes. He helped James reverse the bull"><br>But it’s good that Kuzma found his hand. Otherwise, the Lakers would be hard to survive in this period of time without dual core. If the difference between James and bushmei was widened after they came back in the second half of the game, it would be very difficult for the bushmei, who was already very tired, to reverse the game again because they were in the first three quarters None of them can reach the climax of attack. It’s only by James holding the explosive bag and rushing to the inner line to get back to 10 points. This scoring method is not suitable for James for a long time, and it can take up to 3 minutes.<br>For the Lakers, it’s not just a six game winning streak, they’re relieved at last, because Kuzma has finally found a state. If Kuzma, known as the third core of the Lakers, can open his hand and play at a general level, he can greatly reduce the scoring pressure of bushbrow in the second team. He doesn’t have to play low-level singles in every round. If he meets a team like Spurs It’s hard to use the same tactics to play the second round after one round. At this time, someone needs to stand up and score. This person must be Kuzma.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/04/Lakers key sir! 11 points plus or minus 12 in 6 minutes. He helped James reverse the bull/7f87655e8c9c439db3c876b74a56c740.jpg" alt="Lakers key sir! 11 points plus or minus 12 in 6 minutes. He helped James reverse the bull"><br>However, one thing to say is that Kuzma’s biggest threat is to catch the jump shot without the ball end and hit the basket with the help of the cover instead of holding the ball. This game is a highly efficient performance of Kuzma when he leads the team alone, but it will take a long time for him to have a chemical reaction with the thick eyebrow.</p>

In this game, Nass finally stopped fighting. Instead, he concentrated all the stage and all the shots on Kawaii, which proved to be the only way for the Raptors to win.<br>Eventually, such a resounding battle ended with Leonard’s horrifying and frightening bullet-frame whistle-pressing killing.<br>The four bounces of the ball bouncing over the basket, the 1-2 seconds, seemed to hold the breath of all the people around the world who were watching the game, including all the players on and off the court.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/21/Leonard's jump shot at the bottom corner ended the 2001 and 13 cycles/688a6187be464e67bb1c9112b3c2d50f.jpg" alt="Leonard&#39;s jump shot at the bottom corner ended the 2001 and 13 cycles"><br>​<br>The dishonest, but ultimately seemed to resist the goal that 23,300 spectators in the Canadian Aviation Center Stadium would fall into the net, ending two cycles, one about Leonard in 2013 and the other about the Raptors in 2001.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/21/Leonard's jump shot at the bottom corner ended the 2001 and 13 cycles/61801fd8c6fd4ea998de34193bf700ee.jpg" alt="Leonard&#39;s jump shot at the bottom corner ended the 2001 and 13 cycles"><br>​<br>Leonard 2013<br>Leonard, who played for San Antonio Spurs in the G6 finals in 2013, stood on the free throw line 19.4 seconds before the final.<br>At that time, the Spurs were 3-2 ahead of the three giant Heat teams, while the G6 Spurs were two points ahead of the Heat, which sent Leonard to the free throw line with foul tactics.<br>As long as Leonard withstands the pressure, the Spurs, who are four points ahead of the two penalties, will almost lock in the win.<br>And that’s the penalty shot that might determine the championship. Leonard, who was 22 at the time, had only one in two.<br>The next thing is that the NBA Finals are enough to go down in history.<br>After the suspension, the Heat handed the ball to James, who missed three points from the top of the left arc.

Ray Allen jumped up against Parker and hit the most critical three-point in history for the Heat.<br>The game eventually went into overtime. One of Leonard’s two penalties and three points from Ray Allen may have exhausted the Spurs’spirit. The Heat finally united to win the G6. In the end, the Heat finished the reverse and won two consecutive championships.<br>Today, the same thing seems to happen to Leonard again.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/21/Leonard's jump shot at the bottom corner ended the 2001 and 13 cycles/6f2b64bdcae34330aedd4b2af5f5e405.jpg" alt="Leonard&#39;s jump shot at the bottom corner ended the 2001 and 13 cycles"><br>​<br>In the last 10.8 seconds, 76 people sent Leonard to the free throw line for a tactical foul. In the Eastern Semi-Final Seventh World War, a life-and-death stage, such as robotic Leonard also appeared “machine failure”.<br>Leonard eventually hit one of the two penalties, which directly led to 76 people grabbing the counter-attack, Butler scored the equalizing layup, leaving the Raptors with the last 4.2 seconds.<br>In 4.2 seconds, with the ball near the midline, Leonard dribbled patiently to the bottom right corner, where he had many wins in the season, which is his favorite area.<br>Faced with Simmons and Embed’s sandwich, speed up the breakthrough, and then at the bottom corner, stop and fall back, the ball from the hands of the small card high jump, press the final whistle, play to the basket four knocks, the final hits! <strong><strong>_____</strong></strong><br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/21/Leonard's jump shot at the bottom corner ended the 2001 and 13 cycles/5ecde61d810941ad96c550cc97854278.jpg" alt="Leonard&#39;s jump shot at the bottom corner ended the 2001 and 13 cycles"><br>​<br>This is the first time in the history of the NBA playoffs to win four games in seven games. Leonard spent all his time. This time, the goddess of luck stood beside Leonard.<br>It seems to be the same story six years ago. This time, Leonard, who left the Spurs for the Arctic, wrote a different ending.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/21/Leonard's jump shot at the bottom corner ended the 2001 and 13 cycles/84c0f4f5f8d84ee3a2cf8f78626da8d9.jpg" alt="Leonard&#39;s jump shot at the bottom corner ended the 2001 and 13 cycles"><br>​<br>Raptors 2001<br>In fact, the 2001 Eastern Semi-Final was between 76 men and Raptors, and more coincidentally, both semi-finals reached the seventh, or even the last round of the Seventh World war.<br>It was the league’s first record and 76 people with MVP Allen Iverson who last laughed to the end. This time, the Goddess of Victory favored the Raptors more.<br>In 2001, the last minute of the Seventh World War, with two seconds left, the 76-man team, 88-87 in the lead, was in the hands of one of the opposing teams.<br>Dunking king Vince Carter rounded the top of the arc to the bottom left corner, hit the ground pass, turned back and jumped high. At that moment, 76 people in the First League Center Hall almost suffocated.<br>“Bang!” The high arc shot was originally intended to ensure that the hollow ball was brushed into the basket, but did not want to resist the fate of the choice, the 183 fighter with the ball out of the box running around, was worshipped by Philadelphia fans.<br>The AI released behind the technology stage is like a saint, and in the shadow behind it, Vince Carter is sad.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/21/Leonard's jump shot at the bottom corner ended the 2001 and 13 cycles/cc2094e0adf7465282d72278455fad12.jpg" alt="Leonard&#39;s jump shot at the bottom corner ended the 2001 and 13 cycles"><br>​<br>Eighteen years ago, even though the Raptors regretted not reaching the Eastern Finals, the young team was still full of hope.<br>No one expected that after 18 years, the Raptors, whose best result was to stop in the Eastern Finals, could not go any further, so they traded away the core of their training and recruited Cawaii-Leonard.<br>It was Kawaii’s winner that brought the Raptors back to the Eastern Finals again. The regret of 18 years ago ended their reincarnation here, and this time, Leonard’s Raptors might have done something even greater.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/21/Leonard's jump shot at the bottom corner ended the 2001 and 13 cycles/0c21b632a1094ce9b81daa1345198019.jpg" alt="Leonard&#39;s jump shot at the bottom corner ended the 2001 and 13 cycles"><br>​<br>Toronto’s Present and Future<br>Toronto naturally loves the powerful Leonard. Every time Leonard stands on the free throw line, the deafening MVP calls represent their desire for the superstar.<br>This is also the goal of the Raptors this summer. Leonard’s arrival at the Raptors is actually a helpless move to play a farce with the Spurs.<br>The Raptors hope that through this year’s coexistence and influence, at the same time, they will try to make some impact on Leonard’s future direction.<br>This is closely related to their performance in this year’s playoffs. How can the Raptors finish this year’s playoffs, Eastern Finals? Eastern champion? Even champions?<br>Toronto should not only be ecstatic about the victory, but in fact this promotion, this killing, to some extent, has helped the Raptors to add some weight to retain Leonard.<br>This will give them the chance to compete with the Clippers in the summer.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/21/Leonard's jump shot at the bottom corner ended the 2001 and 13 cycles/09b5e5a41b7c46f5a577524540ece172.jpg" alt="Leonard&#39;s jump shot at the bottom corner ended the 2001 and 13 cycles"><br>​<br>Leonard’s rare seven-whistle strike ended his personal and team rotation, and now the burden is all thrown aside.

    <content><![CDATA[<p>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/12/Looking back on Zhou Qi's NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I/08609f94d5364d1b88c57e0d4bb8242c.jpg" alt="Looking back on Zhou Qi&#39;s NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I"><br>​<br>Zhou Qi was officially laid off by the Rockets on December 18, 2018, at the end of last year. Since then, he has not given up his efforts to return to the NBA. He even once sought the chance to play in Europe. But in the end, Zhou Qi still returned to CBA and Guanghui Club in Xinjiang.<br>Yesterday, the Xinjiang men’s basketball team official announced that the team and Zhou Qi have completed the new contract signing, and will officially submit registration materials to the CBA league. After verification and public approval, Zhou Qi will play as a player of the Xinjiang team in the CBA of the new season.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/12/Looking back on Zhou Qi's NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I/a68d19fd30784a75a720459df5c660fe.jpg" alt="Looking back on Zhou Qi&#39;s NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I"><br>​<br>“When Zhou Qi decided to return to China to continue his basketball career, our club and Zhou Qi had many communications and exchanges on the details of signing the contract. Our Club fully affirms Zhou Qi’s promotion and progress after training in the NBA, and expresses its high sincerity on the premise of abiding by the requirements of the CBA League contract system. Zhou Qi has a rigorous and serious demand for personal career planning, and also expresses his strong feelings for his mother team. Ultimately, the two sides completed the signing in recent days, Zhou Qi officially returned to Guanghui Club as a big family. This is what the Xinjiang men’s basketball official announced.<br>Official propaganda content naturally refers to Zhou Qi’s NBA career. In fact, when Zhou Qi went to the United States to pursue the basketball dream, Xinjiang Team also opened the door to great convenience. After all, the Chinese team is not able to have the ability to attack the NBA, which is also the luck of Chinese basketball. In the past two years, Zhou Qi’s NBA trip is not so smooth, and Or there are other reasons, but ultimately, Zhou Qi chose to leave.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/12/Looking back on Zhou Qi's NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I/73d7998ad7e54e14a00432c11522f5ff.jpg" alt="Looking back on Zhou Qi&#39;s NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I"><br>​<br>At the end of last year, many fans may be surprised when they were laid off, but it seems understandable from Zhou Qi’s repeated demotion to the Rockets and his own performance on the pitch.<br>In his two-year NBA career, Zhou Qi spent most of his time with the Ogrand Valley Serpent Team, which belongs to the Rockets. After all, as a second-round show, the team’s expectations for him were not so great, and the Chinese market behind Zhou Qi has always been the focus of the Rockets.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/12/Looking back on Zhou Qi's NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I/bb85f87b917446f18c5624b7dc8887ad.jpg" alt="Looking back on Zhou Qi&#39;s NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I"><br>​<br>Zhou Qi played only 19 regular-season games in the NBA in two years. Of course, the Rockets had a good winning rate when Zhou Qi played in these two years, with 14 wins and 5 losses, and the winning rate was close to 74%, but Zhou Qi’s personal data can only be said to be general.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/12/Looking back on Zhou Qi's NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I/55d868c3e3d945aabfb212e02dc28538.jpg" alt="Looking back on Zhou Qi&#39;s NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I"><br>​<br>In 19 games, Zhou Qi averaged only 1.3 points, 1.2 rebounds and 0.7 blocked shots per game. The shooting percentage was 21.2%, the three-point shooting rate was 10.5%, and the free throw shooting rate was 66.7%, which were far below the average level of NBA.<br>In the 17-18 season, Zhou Qi’s salary was 820,000 US dollars. In the 18-19 season, Zhou Qi’s salary was 510,000 US dollars. In the two years of NBA career, Zhou Qi’s total salary was 132,000 US dollars without duplicate salary, which translated into RMB, and more than 9.29 million RMB.<br>Zhou Qi even played three games in the playoffs, the first round of the 17-18 season against Timberwolves, but only 2 points and 1 rebounds were scored in three games.<br>In fact, Zhou Qi did not play well in the NBA. On November 22, 2017, when the Rockets were playing at home against the Nuggets, the Rockets established their advantage early and eventually won by 30 points. In this game, Zhou Qi also appeared early and performed well.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/12/Looking back on Zhou Qi's NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I/770005a6f89941ed895d4f3b5d628733.jpg" alt="Looking back on Zhou Qi&#39;s NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I"><br>​<br>Zhou Qi played 12 minutes in the game. He made 2 of 6 shots and 2 of 3 of 4 shots. He finally got 6 points, 2 baskets, 1 assists and 1 blocked shot. The 3 points in 4-2 are enough to surprise people, and Zhou Qi’s frontal cap against Wilson Chandler on the defensive side fanned the ball out of the line directly, which made the fans on the spot exclaim.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/12/Looking back on Zhou Qi's NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I/6a34715546f64fdebd68719de9a8b83f.jpg" alt="Looking back on Zhou Qi&#39;s NBA career, he earned 9.3 million in two years, scored 24 points in 19 occasions, and won the Nuggets World War I"><br>​<br>Zhou Qi’s two-year NBA career is also over. Whether Zhou Qi will continue to attack the NBA in the future, and this year only 23-year-old Zhou Qi naturally still has a lot of hope. We naturally hope that Zhou Qi will one day stand on the stage of the NBA with a stronger posture and blossom a better self.</p>

Maybe this is Bobo&#39;s plan"><br>​<br>Today’s news about the American men’s basketball team is quite interesting. According to the basketball logo Sam Amick, the source disclosed that the American men’s basketball team lost to the accompanying team twice in today’s match.<br>The team is made up of Development League players and NBA edge players. There are also Rocket youngsters who used to make “end-of-the-urinal” free throws by Onouaku. But this team, under the leadership of Jeff Van Gundy, won two straight matches of the American men’s basketball team.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/28/Is the main team losing the accompanying team Don't be afraid. The Dream Team has been so embarrassed. Maybe this is Bobo's plan/2853a58651814b088c2b6b8a5b620468.jpg" alt="Is the main team losing the accompanying team Don&#39;t be afraid. The Dream Team has been so embarrassed. Maybe this is Bobo&#39;s plan"><br>​<br>Of course, the game is not a regular 48 minutes, but 10 minutes per game. The American men’s basketball team lost 3 points to the accompanying team in the first game and 19 points in the second game. The total score of the second game is 17-36.<br>It is reasonable to say that although the major players of the American Men’s Basketball Team left the team during this training camp, either preparing for the new season or resting, the remaining team of the American Men’s Basketball Team is talented enough and strong enough, but the results of the match are really so striking.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/28/Is the main team losing the accompanying team Don't be afraid.

The Dream Team has been so embarrassed. Maybe this is Bobo&#39;s plan"><br>​<br>Most of the remaining 14 players in the U.S. Men’s Basketball Training Camp are the core starters or potential core of each team, including Fox, Mitchell, Tatum, Kuzma and other league upstarts, but such a team can not guarantee to play against a team of Development League players and NBA marginal players. When a team is formed, it wins.<br>The loss of the main team to the accompanying team, which happened to NBA players, should be ashamed or humiliated, but in the United States Men’s Basketball World Cup preparation stage, at this point in time, this kind of loss seems to have some other meaning.<br>It is also easy to recall the experience of the Dream Team that shocked the whole world.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/28/Is the main team losing the accompanying team Don't be afraid.

The Dream Team has been so embarrassed. Maybe this is Bobo&#39;s plan"><br>​<br>Yeah, it’s the historical team made up of Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, Scott Pippen, Carl Malone, David Robinson and other NBA superstars. It’s the team that bled the whole basketball world at the 1992 Olympic Games. It’s called the Dream Team. Teams have had similar experiences.<br>In 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games, the Dream Team won eight games, with an average score of 117.3 points per game and an average net victory of 43.8 points per game. It won the gold medal in an invincible manner, which made the world feel the top charm of American professional basketball.<br>But such a dream team still lost to a team of American college students before leaving for Barcelona.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/28/Is the main team losing the accompanying team Don't be afraid.

The Dream Team has been so embarrassed. Maybe this is Bobo&#39;s plan"><br>​<br>Of course, there are also Chris Weber, who later made his mark in the NBA, Penny Hadaway and Grant Hill, but in any case, the star of this team is almost no more than that of the Dream Team.<br>Nevertheless, the first contest between Dream Team I and this college students’accompanying team is still the victory of the college students’ accompanying team.<br>Later, the Dream Team coach, Chuck Daley, claimed that he arranged the game to make the Dream Team players understand that losing is also possible.<br>Such a truth is still applicable to today’s U.S. team. Even without a lot of star flavor, the strength of the United States is still ahead of any opponent in the World Cup. Under such circumstances, they must understand that pride may be the biggest opponent.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/28/Is the main team losing the accompanying team Don't be afraid.

<h1 id="Brother’s-injury-and-Durant’s-injury"><a href="#Brother’s-injury-and-Durant’s-injury" class="headerlink" title="Brother’s injury and Durant’s injury"></a>Brother’s injury and Durant’s injury</h1><p>In a radio interview today, one brother revealed a rather intriguing message. One brother said that the warriors had not concealed Durant’s injuries for the first time this year.<br>One elder brother said that he met the same situation last year.<br>“I missed the last three games in the Rockets series. We hit the seventh and we were almost eliminated. They looked at me and asked me,”When will you come back?” My leg was broken, but what was announced was a bone contusion. I fought with the team, people and the media. Then my teammates came to me every day and asked me, “How do you feel?” One elder brother said.<br>Last year against the Rockets in the Western Finals series, the first turning point in the series was the injury concession series. After that, the Rockets won two games in a row, rewriting the score to 3-2.<br>If Paul stayed behind last year, the Rockets might have crossed the Warriors into the Finals, while Igodara did not return until the G3 in the Finals.<br>Of course, last year’s Warriors won the championship, and champagne will dilute many contradictions, but this year the situation has changed.<br>This year’s Golden State Warriors also injured Kevin Durant in the series against the Rockets, and this injury is more related to the Warriors’over-use of Durant.<br>Durant averaged more than 44 minutes in the first four games of the Western Semi-Finals series, but the two sides were still tied 2-2. In the most desperate battle, Durant injured his calf and finally came back to the G5 in the Finals.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/19/Losers can expose problems, and a mistake by management could disintegrate the Warriors Tsunami Combination/fffb56bd9d444b24adeead238792f52b.jpg" alt="Losers can expose problems, and a mistake by management could disintegrate the Warriors Tsunami Combination"><br>​<br>Obviously, according to one brother, the Warriors’announcement of the injury was also concealed. Durant probably injured the Achilles tendon the first time he was injured.<br>On the stage of the finals, the Warriors seemed to be less passionate and focused on the Rockets G6 and the Blazers because of their hope for Durant’s return.<br>The 1-3 lag also put the Warriors and Durant in a very embarrassing situation. As a result, Durant seems to be facing the same situation as last year’s brother. There are always teammates who inadvertently ask Durant “how do you feel”. The overwhelming media criticism also makes the sensitive Durant feel insecure.<br>As a result, Durant chose to play with injuries. He only lasted 11 minutes and 57 seconds and then fell again. This time, with the result that his Achilles tendon was broken.<br>For this historic small forward, the impact of the Achilles tendon rupture on his career is undoubtedly devastating.<br>The Warriors’deliberate concealment of the injury, and the smoke bombs of the Warriors’ PR about Durant’s injury and illness one after another, undoubtedly indirectly promoted and caused the ultimate consequences.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/19/Losers can expose problems, and a mistake by management could disintegrate the Warriors Tsunami Combination/9bd1cd0010f1440ba5190e10290efbad.jpg" alt="Losers can expose problems, and a mistake by management could disintegrate the Warriors Tsunami Combination"><br>​</p>
<h1 id="The-Choice-of-Summer"><a href="#The-Choice-of-Summer" class="headerlink" title="The Choice of Summer"></a>The Choice of Summer</h1><p>Of course, we can start from Durant’s personal point of view, his desire for victory, his teammates’urgency to help the team finally let him stand on the court like a hero.<br>The 1-3 lag is desperate, but it seems that Durant is still the dominant team as long as he is on the field. In the first quarter of the final G5, the Warriors showed such dominance.<br>The final result of the G5 was also good. The Warriors seemed to be stimulated by Durant. They found their lost champion’s heart in the desperate situation and finally won the G5.<br>But in the home game of G6, the Warriors lost Clay again after losing Durant, which made the Warriors desperate again when they tried to create a miracle with a gush of blood.<br>The final game ended with Stephen Curie’s unsuccessful victory. The sad warriors did not stop their fate with their efforts. The Toronto Raptor King ascended the throne. With Durant and Clay’s casualties, the Warrior Dynasty seemed to be on the verge of collapse.<br>For the Warriors, they will need to consider the contract renewal of Clay and KD in the coming summer.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/19/Losers can expose problems, and a mistake by management could disintegrate the Warriors Tsunami Combination/2b60144a723c4e30a787dddc67490c56.jpg" alt="Losers can expose problems, and a mistake by management could disintegrate the Warriors Tsunami Combination"><br>​<br>Clay will be a free agent this summer, and Durant will be able to jump out of the existing contract and execute the player option to become a free agent.<br>The Warriors, even though they will lose competitiveness for a short time next season, will still be able to make a comeback after a season if they can keep Clay and KD.<br>But the reality is that the Warriors will not hesitate to offer top-salary contracts to Clay and KD after they suffered serious career-affecting injuries.<br>If Clay and KD are not injured, I believe you will also think that the Warriors team with a complete lineup can still win the total championship of the 2018-19 season smoothly and complete the three-time championship.<br>If the three consecutive championships are completed, throwing a lot of money to renew KD and Clay is not a problem for this brilliant Warriors team.<br>But now, three consecutive championship breaks, KD and Clay have suffered serious injuries that athletes can not afford, and their returning status is still questionable.<br>If the Warriors give Clay and KD the top salary at this time, they will not only have to bear the super luxury tax, KD almost certainly will miss the next season, Clay will also miss most of the regular season, only a warrior supported by a Curie, will lose competitiveness in the West.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/19/Losers can expose problems, and a mistake by management could disintegrate the Warriors Tsunami Combination/c5b20ffe735e4e869c5435a8fb33df73.jpg" alt="Losers can expose problems, and a mistake by management could disintegrate the Warriors Tsunami Combination"><br>​<br>That is, if the Warriors renew their contract, the next year’s contract will default to spending money for Clay and KD injuries, and also bear the risk of recovery after their return.<br>But at the same time, if the Warriors do not leave Clay and KD, they may also face a more serious crisis of trust.<br>Clay was chosen by the Warriors in 2011. His countless gestures to pull back the storm in adversity have convinced thousands of warriors fans. The so-called but humorous Clay is very popular with Bay Area fans because of this injury and eventually let him go, not to mention how terrible the future Clay is as an opponent, and the warriors fans themselves are terrified. No one can accept that the Shuihua Brothers’backcourt combination has split up.<br>Durant joined the Warriors in 2016. Since then, the Golden State Warriors have begun to fight against the world. They have gone all the way, won the revenge championship in the 2007-18 season, and won the sweet two consecutive championships in the 2018-19 season.<br>KD is known as the “god of death” of the warriors in the league, his goal killing in the downwind, his CIC stabilization in the upstream, and even a record shooting in the other side’s heart is desperate. The existence of KD really makes the warriors’shortboard become the top side of the league, and also makes the warriors truly invincible in the world.<br>However, if these two meritorious officials are abandoned by the Warriors after suffering injuries and illnesses, there will be quite a sad sense that some people will go to tea. At the same time, for a team’s culture, they will also be subjected to subsequent counter-attack.<br>It’s a business league, but ultimately the core part is still the flesh and blood players. The team’s cold-blooded operation sometimes pays off in the present, but the long-term impact is necessarily negative, as we can see from the Celtics’situation.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/19/Losers can expose problems, and a mistake by management could disintegrate the Warriors Tsunami Combination/d165073c44494688999010f0c29b28b0.jpg" alt="Losers can expose problems, and a mistake by management could disintegrate the Warriors Tsunami Combination"><br>​</p>

So the Warriors will certainly hope to find a breakthrough point to attract fans.<br>Curie will still be on this team. He’s still a box office guarantee for the Warriors, but if the Warriors can’t keep Clay or KD, their reputation in the free market may not be as good as they think.<br>The Warriors’team culture has always been well known in the league. Stephen Cooley entered the Warriors from the era of the Bay Area Bandits. Now the team atmosphere of the Warriors has become much happier and more pleasant because of Stephen Curry’s personal charm.<br>But the Warriors’owners, as team owners, may be more interested in thinking about issues.<br>The most obvious thing is that the Warriors actually benefited a lot from Kuri’s four-year, $44 million contract. In 2017, when Kuri’s next contract needed to be filled out again, everyone thought that the Warriors should not hesitate to give him a super top salary.<br>In fact, Curie eventually got a five-year super-top salary, which is the best reward for his persistence for so many years.<br>But during the signing of the contract, Warrior’s boss even thought of not giving Curie a top salary, which of course was quickly discouraged by Warrior General Manager Bob Miles.<br>In addition, the Warriors and Stephen Curie signed a five-year contract, Curie had tried to obtain a trade veto, but the Warriors did not eventually give.<br>Although these two points do not affect the final results, but the attitude of management is put there, even can be said to be the first person in the history of the Warriors Curie has let the Warriors boss hesitate, then come to Clay and KD in front of this difficult problem, the Warriors will make choices?<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/19/Losers can expose problems, and a mistake by management could disintegrate the Warriors Tsunami Combination/062ac9adc64f460593f047d58ae34632.jpg" alt="Losers can expose problems, and a mistake by management could disintegrate the Warriors Tsunami Combination"><br>​<br>It’s not alarmist that the injured Clay and KD were abandoned and the Warriors’injury concealment could lead to a complete loss of the Warriors’ future direction.<br>This dangerous and potential pitfall, the Warriors need to be careful this summer.</p>

    <title>Lost 46 points! Thompson shook his head and grinned bitterly. Le Fu was depressed. Is this a gift for the boss to visit his doctor</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>At the end of today’s pre-season game, the Celtics won three consecutive victories at home by 118-72 points over the Cavaliers. No one would have thought that the knight would suffer such a crushing defeat. Although Thompson and Love truce today, the knight would not be beaten like this.<br>After all, the Cavaliers did not make a bad start: 1 Sexton + 2 Dravidowa + 3 Ottoman + 4 Little Nans + 5 Martin. Sexton was the Cavaliers’first new recruit last season, while Dravidova was known for his defensive qualities. Plus Ottoman’s attack and defense on the flanks, Nancy’s eating bread under the basket, Martin’s frame and rebound.<br>In theory, the Cavaliers still have the strength to fight, but in the whole game, the Cavaliers basically resisted only one quarter, and then three quarters were humiliated by the Green Army, there is no room for resistance.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Lost 46 points! Thompson shook his head and grinned bitterly. Le Fu was depressed. Is this a gift for the boss to visit his doctor/7c1cb92463564498a371d27baa1db67e.jpg" alt="Lost 46 points! Thompson shook his head and grinned bitterly. Le Fu was depressed. Is this a gift for the boss to visit his doctor"><br>In the first quarter, the Knights and Celtics were caught in the iron, and both felt bad. But Celtic have defense, they still rely on defense when they can’t score. Another is Kenbawalker, who started to drive the team when the Green Army’s offensive stalled.<br>First, Hayward made a delicate connection and hit three points. After that, Walker not only scored killing points, but also led the Green Army to a wave of attacks, leading the Celtics by five points in the first quarter. These five points are only a harbinger of the storm, because the Celtics broke out in the second quarter.<br>They started a defensive counter-attack, and Jay Brown, who demanded the highest salary, showed horrible dominance, not only scoring in a row under the basket, but also hitting three points on the outside, one man scoring seven points in a row. After a wave of 11-0, the Celtics were 16 points ahead.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Lost 46 points! Thompson shook his head and grinned bitterly. Le Fu was depressed. Is this a gift for the boss to visit his doctor/5916209f46214a13a894a85ad49d1c01.jpg" alt="Lost 46 points! Thompson shook his head and grinned bitterly. Le Fu was depressed. Is this a gift for the boss to visit his doctor"><br>After that, the Celtics offensive remained unchanged. Walker took over the baton in the middle of the second quarter and led the team to hit the attack wave again. The difference has been drawn to 31 points. The game was basically settled. The Celtics fought harder and harder in the second half, and the Cavaliers surrendered in white. The maximum difference in the last quarter has been opened to 50 points.<br>Today’s game, though not the Cavaliers’new season fixture. But their performance was frustrating because the knights had little resilience. They are like scattered sand, like the sun in the past few years.<br>As long as they lag behind a lot, they begin to give up. They have no intention of competing with their opponents at all. The three demons of the Knight also behaved badly.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Lost 46 points! Thompson shook his head and grinned bitterly. Le Fu was depressed. Is this a gift for the boss to visit his doctor/3156eaae905b4d34aad52127485fc77a.jpg" alt="Lost 46 points! Thompson shook his head and grinned bitterly. Le Fu was depressed. Is this a gift for the boss to visit his doctor"><br>James’s youngest brother, Osman, did poorly throughout the game, scoring only two points in one of his 10. Sexton scored 4 points in 1 of 8, and Porter scored 4 points in 1 of 8. These three are the three evil stars that Knights value very much. The boss had fantasized that they would become All-Stars in the future.<br>But three out of 26 of the three scored 10 points. Twenty-six shots in exchange for ten points. For knights, they were disappointed. Even if Rover and Thompson are here today, can the Cavaliers win the Celtics? I’m afraid it’s impossible.<br>From the Cavaliers fans’point of view, they may still be in bad shape next season. It’s nothing for new people, but it’s too exhausting for the old ones.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Lost 46 points! Thompson shook his head and grinned bitterly. Le Fu was depressed. Is this a gift for the boss to visit his doctor/84faaefb591e4856b4f0c41c090f747b.jpg" alt="Lost 46 points! Thompson shook his head and grinned bitterly. Le Fu was depressed. Is this a gift for the boss to visit his doctor"><br>Several new Cavaliers apologized publicly after the race, but that didn’t make sense. Because Rover was very frustrated to see all this, this summer, Rover said that the Cavaliers could be in the playoffs next season. But now? I’m afraid Rover is going back to Timberwolves again. He can’t make it into the playoffs anyway.<br>We all know that James had a great influence on knights, but we didn’t expect it to be so great. Ultimately, Knights have no backbone and no leader can stand up and give orders.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Lost 46 points! Thompson shook his head and grinned bitterly. Le Fu was depressed. Is this a gift for the boss to visit his doctor/26b50efdedf3482a89227d5f8003b17e.jpg" alt="Lost 46 points! Thompson shook his head and grinned bitterly. Le Fu was depressed. Is this a gift for the boss to visit his doctor"><br>In addition, according to Chris Fedor, a journalist with the Cleveland Honest, the knight’s owner, Gilbert, has now been discharged and returned to his home. All the Knights are going to visit the owner’s house. Now you take the score of 46 points as a gift to see a doctor?<br>The Cavalier’s recent situation is also very bad for TT Thompson, who will expire his $82 million contract in the next five years. With the Cavalier’s current performance, Thompson’s next big contract is somewhat suspended.</p>

    <title>NBA Player Ranking James fourth, which three are ahead of Zhan Huang</title>
    <url>/2019/08/11/NBA%20Player%20Ranking%20James%20fourth,%20which%20three%20are%20ahead%20of%20Zhan%20Huang/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The 42-year-old Carter has been awarded a new contract extension from the Hawks, which means that the former “demigod” will start his 22nd NBA season. For 22 consecutive seasons, it is also extremely rare in the history of the NBA.<br>Not surprisingly, Old Carter’s regular-season appearances will surpass Stockton and Nowitzki next season and rise to third place in the history of the NBA. With Nowitzki’s retirement last season, Carter became the most active NBA player with 1481 appearances.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/11/NBA Player Ranking James fourth, which three are ahead of Zhan Huang/b4eff3ec60dc4114b7125c775c84129f.jpg" alt="NBA Player Ranking James fourth, which three are ahead of Zhan Huang"><br>​<br>So what are the top ten players in active service besides Carter?<br>No. 2 was Jamal Crawford from the Suns, who played 1326 games. Crawford played 64 games last season, averaging 7.9 points and 3.6 assists in 18.9 minutes. So far Crawford has not been awarded an NBA contract, although he has played 19 seasons in the league, but apparently he can make a lot of contributions on the court.<br>The third is Paul Gasol, who has just signed a one-year contract with the Trail Blazers, who has played 1226 games so far. Gasol played 30 games last season, averaging only 3.9 points and 4.6 rebounds per game. Gasol, who still had enough heat in the Spurs in the first half of the season, was traded to the Bucks and did not have much chance to play because of his incompatibility with the team’s style. But as a veteran, his leadership is not to be underestimated, Gasol will be a powerful complement to the pioneers.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/11/NBA Player Ranking James fourth, which three are ahead of Zhan Huang/aad7955f0896426fabc5ffc974e8cecf.jpg" alt="NBA Player Ranking James fourth, which three are ahead of Zhan Huang"><br>​<br>Next came LeBron James of the Lakers, who played 1198 games. Years seem to have left no trace on the historical superstar. James averaged 27 points, 8 rebounds and 8 assists per game last season, with a shooting percentage of more than 50%.<br>Even though he has played 16 seasons in the league, James has maintained the league’s first-class level with super self-control and hard training, which is unusual in the history of the NBA.<br>In the new season, the Lakers signed Anthony Davis stars and many excellent role players, James will also make another impact on the championship in his 17th season.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/11/NBA Player Ranking James fourth, which three are ahead of Zhan Huang/c4e46d7bdc774e979007ff082c54454c.jpg" alt="NBA Player Ranking James fourth, which three are ahead of Zhan Huang"><br>​<br>The fifth place was Kyle Cowell from the Bucks, who played 1174 games. As one of the only two remaining players in the league in 2003 (James, the other), when he became a free agent, Covol quickly handed out the rugby branch to the Bucks. He finally chose a contract of 2.6 million a year to join the Bucks. Kowal’s career three-point shooting rate is as high as 42.9%. He is a phenomenal three-point shooter. His joining will greatly increase the Bucks’hope of breaking out of the East.<br>The sixth is Tyson Chandler, who has just joined the Rockets and has played 1134 games. The champion will also help the new double-core Rockets become a hot team for championship.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/11/NBA Player Ranking James fourth, which three are ahead of Zhan Huang/2ee658c53a3648ed89a4f553af5e306d.jpg" alt="NBA Player Ranking James fourth, which three are ahead of Zhan Huang"><br>​<br>Seventh in the list is Andre Igdala, who was traded to Grizzlies by the Warriors, with 1108 appearances. The former FMVP couldn’t change the game because of his injuries, but when the team needed it, Igdala would open the coffin and become an important part of the competition.<br>The next three longest-serving NBA players were Patria (1098 games), Cameron Anthony (1064 games) and Dwight Howard (1044 games).<br>Dead people like this, day and night. I hope you fans will cherish every game of the players and every inch of the time we watch the ball. It is not only the professional career of the players, but also our youth that will grow old.</p>

    <title>NBA Superstars with the most trophies Kobe Bryant, Duncan 12, Jordan 22, James</title>
    <url>/2019/08/21/NBA%20Superstars%20with%20the%20most%20trophies%20Kobe%20Bryant,%20Duncan%2012,%20Jordan%2022,%20James/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/21/NBA Superstars with the most trophies Kobe Bryant, Duncan 12, Jordan 22, James/73c2de671f6249ae815edcc4ce419863.jpg" alt="NBA Superstars with the most trophies Kobe Bryant, Duncan 12, Jordan 22, James"><br>​<br>Primary school students all know the importance of the certificate, which is the substantive performance of the award they receive, and also something that can be made public.<br>In the NBA, there are many similar “certificates” and the most important is the six awards: championship, finals MVP, regular season MVP, best defensive player, All-Star MVP and best rookie award.<br>For example, the best defensive team, the best lineup, and the All-Star selection, these are the honors of the players, but will not appear in the trophies and awards.<br>And seasonal data such as scoring champion and rebounding champion will not show. Although All-Star dunk champion or skill champion has trophies, their influence on the whole career is limited.<br>So based on these six awards, we can see which gods in history have won the cup soft?<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/21/NBA Superstars with the most trophies Kobe Bryant, Duncan 12, Jordan 22, James/c16a5e9dc15e4dfb9e3a336417768aec.jpg" alt="NBA Superstars with the most trophies Kobe Bryant, Duncan 12, Jordan 22, James"><br>​<br>Fifth place, Kobe Bryant, 12 trophies<br>Kobe Bryant has won five championships in his career. Although the first three FMVPs were won by O’Neill, the absolute core of the team at that time, Kobe Bryant undoubtedly won the award of FMVP in the last two consecutive championships.<br>Although Kobe has entered the best defensive lineup many times in his career, it is not easy for defenders to get the best defensive players. Kobe failed to get DPOY in the end.<br>But Kobe has won only one MVP award in his entire career, which may be surprising, but it also proves the value of MVP. Even better than Kobe, he may not get MVP in an unsuitable season. After all, MVP needs to consider the influence of data and record comprehensively. However, Bryant’s All-Star MVP number can be quite a lot, a total of four times, ranking first in history.<br>Together, Bryant’s six Career Awards totaled 12 trophies.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/21/NBA Superstars with the most trophies Kobe Bryant, Duncan 12, Jordan 22, James/85f82cdf6bc34664ada2db599a9fbc6a.jpg" alt="NBA Superstars with the most trophies Kobe Bryant, Duncan 12, Jordan 22, James"><br>​<br>Fourth place, Duncan, 12 trophies<br>Duncan’s career was also five champions, but Duncan won three of the Finals MVP, and Duncan won the MVP awards in 2002 and 2003.<br>Similar to Kobe, Duncan has not won DPOY awards in his career although he has been selected for defense for a while. However, Duncan’s advantage over Kobe is that in the rookie season, Duncan has been selected for a couple of seasons and has naturally won the best rookie without any doubt.<br>Duncan has only one All-Star MVP in his career, but Duncan’s style is not suitable for all-Star stage, and it’s good to get one.<br>Together, Duncan’s six Career Awards have won 12 trophies, just like Kobe’s.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/21/NBA Superstars with the most trophies Kobe Bryant, Duncan 12, Jordan 22, James/375ed85b338549678b691e6f46a78b87.jpg" alt="NBA Superstars with the most trophies Kobe Bryant, Duncan 12, Jordan 22, James"><br>​<br>Third place, Magician, 13 trophies<br>Magic’s rookie season has already shocked the league. In rookie season, he rushed to the finals and became a center and eventually won FMVP. But most curiously, in the competition with Larry Bird’s best rookie, Magic failed to compete and finally lost the best rookie trophy.<br>However, five championships and three FMVPs are still solid awards. In the fierce competition in the 1980s, magicians have won three MVPs, and All-Star MVPs have won two, quite fierce.<br>Six awards for magician’s career totaled 13 trophies.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/21/NBA Superstars with the most trophies Kobe Bryant, Duncan 12, Jordan 22, James/1c78579e7fd14eac8d2495bbb64a2dd0.jpg" alt="NBA Superstars with the most trophies Kobe Bryant, Duncan 12, Jordan 22, James"><br>​<br>Second place, LeBron James, 14 trophies<br>LeBron James’s entire career is at its peak, the best performance in more than a decade.<br>Although the three championships are not much compared with other big gods, FMVP in the three finals is not much compared with other players. James’s advantage lies in the regular season MVP. He has won four championships altogether, even within five years.<br>James also won three All-Star MVPs in his career, ranking second in history. He also won the best rookie, and the total number of trophies came to 14, ranking second in history.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/21/NBA Superstars with the most trophies Kobe Bryant, Duncan 12, Jordan 22, James/c7b32cbb206f43d7b5bb8739cf1eaab2.jpg" alt="NBA Superstars with the most trophies Kobe Bryant, Duncan 12, Jordan 22, James"><br>​<br>First place, Michael Jordan, 22 trophies<br>God’s dominance, whether in the field of competition, data or honor statistics, is full of dominance. In the ranking of trophies, Jordan still dominates by a huge advantage.<br>The best rookie still has no doubt. Jordan’s rookie season was 28.2 points, which is quite exaggerated; Jordan’s career has won three All-Star MVPs; the conventional MVP has won five.<br>Jordan is also the only defender who has won the best defensive player in history. More importantly, the first person in Jordan’s history is Jordan’s six finals, six Championships and six FMVP honors.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/21/NBA Superstars with the most trophies Kobe Bryant, Duncan 12, Jordan 22, James/3604200b72484946bf96f099e3f37b88.jpg" alt="NBA Superstars with the most trophies Kobe Bryant, Duncan 12, Jordan 22, James"><br>​<br>Coupled with these trophies, Jordan’s career trophies totaled 22, leading James in the second place by up to 8, and the God of basketball deserves to be the God of basketball.</p>

    <title>NBA superstar debut, Kobe Bryant 0 points, James 25 + 6 + 9 strong enough, but this monster 43 + 28</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/10/NBA superstar debut, Kobe Bryant 0 points, James 25 + 6 + 9 strong enough, but this monster 43 + 28/13d309e7296a430fb2996132cc00e1bc.jpg" alt="NBA superstar debut, Kobe Bryant 0 points, James 25 + 6 + 9 strong enough, but this monster 43 + 28"><br>​<br>The growth path of NBA superstars is unique. Every superstar rises in a variety of ways. Some stars are the focus of attention from the beginning. Some stars just entered the league are still unknown, even struggling, but ultimately they are the top of the basketball palace.<br>The starting point of the superstar road is their first official game in the league, which is the first show. For the team, the first show is the first formal assessment for the players. No matter how well these players have performed in overseas leagues, NCAA or high school leagues before, the first time they can show the highest level in the NBA level confrontation, in order to truly meet the needs of the team.<br>From the player’s point of view, the first show is like the first assessment of their basketball career. Sometimes, the results of this assessment can directly affect their whole career process.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/10/NBA superstar debut, Kobe Bryant 0 points, James 25 + 6 + 9 strong enough, but this monster 43 + 28/fb52448d545647baac561d8da2025149.jpg" alt="NBA superstar debut, Kobe Bryant 0 points, James 25 + 6 + 9 strong enough, but this monster 43 + 28"><br>​<br>Not all the players who grew up to be League superstars made their debuts smooth or even killed all sides. For example, Kobe Bryant, the best scoring guard of the 21st century so far, had some “awkward” debuts.<br>Kobe’s debut date was November 3, 1996. In fact, it was inside the Lakers. He was also interested in the 18-year-old high school player. The team used Divac, who was already a famous center in the league.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/10/NBA superstar debut, Kobe Bryant 0 points, James 25 + 6 + 9 strong enough, but this monster 43 + 28/e64f5645728047c9a0eaca60a5450c95.jpg" alt="NBA superstar debut, Kobe Bryant 0 points, James 25 + 6 + 9 strong enough, but this monster 43 + 28"><br>​<br>But Kobe Bryant’s debut was only a six-minute substitute, with 0-point, 1-point, 1-cap and 1-fault. At that time, the Lakers’backbone was O’Neill, who wildly chopped 35+19+3-aid and 3-cap to win.<br>Young Kobe Bryant has been on the bench for the first two seasons, but even O’Neill, who scored 35 points in Bryant’s first show, did not expect that this young man could really grow into a top player in the league, even the official rise of Kobe Bryant, so that the Lakers really have the strength to hit the third consecutive championship.<br>As for Kobe’s brilliant and brilliant career since then, at least from the poor performance of his first show, it is entirely unrecognizable.<br>When James grew up to be one of the top players in the league, especially in 2009, the world regretted missing out on James and Kobe Bryant’s peak rivalry, but the beginning of their careers was totally different.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/10/NBA superstar debut, Kobe Bryant 0 points, James 25 + 6 + 9 strong enough, but this monster 43 + 28/81e4e8f21d784aefa22f9ad1d4dbb713.jpg" alt="NBA superstar debut, Kobe Bryant 0 points, James 25 + 6 + 9 strong enough, but this monster 43 + 28"><br>​<br>Although Kobe Bryant is also a gifted high school student, at that time in 1996, the high school player was only an attempt of the NBA. By 2003, James, who is also a gifted high school student, had become the focus of attention of the whole American basketball circle.<br>The chosen one tattoo is still on James’s back. He was indeed a great sensation in the United States. Even before entering the NBA, he was awarded a seven-year, $90 million high-priced contract from Nike.<br>The first show of “Son of Nature” did not disappoint all the people who thought about it. On October 29, 2003, LeBron James started the game, playing 42 minutes, shooting 12 of 20 shots, scoring 25 points, 6 rebounds, 9 assists and 4 steals. It was amazing.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/10/NBA superstar debut, Kobe Bryant 0 points, James 25 + 6 + 9 strong enough, but this monster 43 + 28/88c31a86812c4b32a853308b750bbc92.jpg" alt="NBA superstar debut, Kobe Bryant 0 points, James 25 + 6 + 9 strong enough, but this monster 43 + 28"><br>​<br>James, who averaged 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists in the rookie season, became the third player in NBA history to cut 20+5+5 in the rookie season. The first two players were Big O Robertson and Michael Jordan.<br>James’s debut figures are arguably strong enough, but looking at the history of the NBA, people will certainly focus on one person, “basketball emperor” Wilt Chamberlain.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/10/NBA superstar debut, Kobe Bryant 0 points, James 25 + 6 + 9 strong enough, but this monster 43 + 28/0cd2d238da4d4a1a9a820069d6fffe11.jpg" alt="NBA superstar debut, Kobe Bryant 0 points, James 25 + 6 + 9 strong enough, but this monster 43 + 28"><br>​<br>Chamberlain’s NBA debut against the Knicks, in the first game of the league, he hit 43 points and 28 rebounds. The stealing and blocking data at that time had not been counted, otherwise the data might be more exaggerated.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/10/NBA superstar debut, Kobe Bryant 0 points, James 25 + 6 + 9 strong enough, but this monster 43 + 28/0042f265e37e4668b321acd85e0c586a.jpg" alt="NBA superstar debut, Kobe Bryant 0 points, James 25 + 6 + 9 strong enough, but this monster 43 + 28"><br>​<br>Chamberlain’s rookie season averaged 37.6 points and 27 rebounds, including the best rookie, All-Star MVP and regular season MVP, which all sounded unreal, but it is also the best embodiment of his ability to surpass the times.</p>

    <title>NBA active players ranked James fourth, and which three are in front of James</title>
    <url>/2019/09/02/NBA%20active%20players%20ranked%20James%20fourth,%20and%20which%20three%20are%20in%20front%20of%20James/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The 42-year-old old Carter once again won a contract extension from the Hawks, which means that the former “half-man” will begin his 22nd NBA season. Playing for 22 consecutive seasons is extremely rare in NBA history.<br>Not surprisingly, the old Carter’s regular-season appearances will surpass Stockton and Nowitzki next season and rise to third place in NBA history. With the retirement of Nowitzki last season, Carter became the player with the most appearances among active NBA players with 1,481 appearances.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/09/02/NBA active players ranked James fourth, and which three are in front of James/b4eff3ec60dc4114b7125c775c84129f.jpg" alt="NBA active players ranked James fourth, and which three are in front of James"><br>​<br>So what are the top ten players in active duty, except for Carter?<br>Ranked second is Jamal Crawford from the Suns, playing a total of 1,326 games. Last season, Crawford played a total of 64 games, averaging 7.9 points and 3.6 assists in 18.9 minutes per game. Crawford has not yet won an NBA contract, and although he has been in the league for 19 seasons, he is clearly able to make a significant contribution on the court.<br>The third place is Paul Gasol, who has just signed a one-year contract with the Trail Blazers. He has played 1226 games so far. Last season’s Gasol played 30 games, averaging only 3.9 points and 4.6 rebounds. In the first half of the season, Gasol, who still played the heat in the Spurs, was traded to the Bucks and was not consistent with the team’s style. There are not many opportunities to play. But as a veteran, his leadership ability is not to be underestimated, Gasol will be a powerful complement to the pioneers.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/09/02/NBA active players ranked James fourth, and which three are in front of James/aad7955f0896426fabc5ffc974e8cecf.jpg" alt="NBA active players ranked James fourth, and which three are in front of James"><br>​<br>Next is the Lakers’ LeBron James, who played 1,198 games. The years seem to have not left a trace on this historical superstar. Last season, James averaged 27 points, 8 rebounds and 8 assists per game, and his shooting percentage exceeded 50%.<br>Even though he has been in the league for 16 seasons, James still maintains the league’s first-class standards with superb self-control and hard training, which is uncommon in NBA history.<br>In the new season, the Lakers signed Anthony Davis and other outstanding role players. James will once again attack the championship in his 17th season.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/09/02/NBA active players ranked James fourth, and which three are in front of James/c4e46d7bdc774e979007ff082c54454c.jpg" alt="NBA active players ranked James fourth, and which three are in front of James"><br>​<br>Ranked fifth is Kyle Korver from the Bucks, playing a total of 1,174 games. As one of the two remaining players in the league in 2003 (the other is James), Korver quickly gave the team an olive branch after becoming a free agent. He eventually chose to join the Bucks with a contract of 2.6 million a year. team. Korver’s career 3-point shooting rate is as high as 42.9%. He is a phenomenal three-pointer. His joining will greatly increase the hope that the Bucks will rush out of the East.<br>Ranked sixth is Tyson Chandler, who just joined the Rockets, and played a total of 1,134 games. The boxing champion will also help the new dual-core Rockets become a popular team for the championship.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/09/02/NBA active players ranked James fourth, and which three are in front of James/2ee658c53a3648ed89a4f553af5e306d.jpg" alt="NBA active players ranked James fourth, and which three are in front of James"><br>​<br>Ranked seventh is Andre Iguodala, who was traded to the Grizzlies by the Warriors, and played a total of 1,108 games. The former FMVP couldn’t change the game because of the injury, but when the team needed it, Iguodala would also open the coffin board to become an important part of the game.<br>The next three active NBA players were Pachulia (1098 games), Carmelo Anthony (1064 games) and Dwight Howard (1044 games).<br>The deceased, such as Steve, stayed up late. I hope that fans will cherish every game of the players, cherish every inch of our time watching the ball, the old is not only the career of the players, but also our youth.</p>

    <title>One in eight scored only three points! The 17-year-old Prime Minister really can&#39;t come back. He was completely separated by Baltatatum</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>At the end of today’s pre-season game, the Magic defeated the Celtics 75-100 at home. The magic was shattered from the first quarter, with a score of 21-2. The huge gap between Magic and Celtics is somewhat elusive.<br>Because last season magic at least also made the playoffs, but this season although it is the pre-season magic seems to return to the same way. On the court, the players were listless and rowed freely.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/One in eight scored only three points! The 17-year-old Prime Minister really can't come back. He was completely separated by Baltatatum/f3b2fc0e97e840c98ab9c7275859ab11.jpg" alt="One in eight scored only three points! The 17-year-old Prime Minister really can&#39;t come back. He was completely separated by Baltatatum"><br>If the regular season starts in this state, Magic will probably miss the playoffs again this year. After all, the Eastern Conference is not competitive, but it is not a casual playoff.<br>In addition, today’s top player in 17 years, Ron fultz, undoubtedly played a not very good game. Fultz came on as a substitute for 21 minutes and only got 3 points, 1 rebound, 4 assists and 1 steal in 8 shots. There are many videos about Fultz this summer. Some American media think Fultz got his shooting bag back.<br>But judging from the recent situation of the game, fultz still has some problems in shooting.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/One in eight scored only three points! The 17-year-old Prime Minister really can't come back. He was completely separated by Baltatatum/a79f4038a34b47c3ac564d4b83860df0.jpg" alt="One in eight scored only three points! The 17-year-old Prime Minister really can&#39;t come back. He was completely separated by Baltatatum"><br>In college, Fultz shot very elegant, all kinds of beautiful shots. But now Fultz’s shot is a bit late, a bit like a push shot. It seems to be similar to the previous season’s brother Bauer. This is definitely not the type of shooter Fultz used to shoot in college.<br>It can only be said that Fultz’s strange illness almost ruined his career, it is worth mentioning that in the last spurs. Fultz played 17 minutes, 8 shots 3, 6 points 2 rebounds 4 assists 2 steals.<br>He seems to have changed from the pride of the past to a qualified substitute. After the game, fultz also reflected publicly. He thought that his performance was not very good or he could not integrate into the game.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/One in eight scored only three points! The 17-year-old Prime Minister really can't come back. He was completely separated by Baltatatum/287895a1ec534787859086170e612ddb.jpg" alt="One in eight scored only three points! The 17-year-old Prime Minister really can&#39;t come back. He was completely separated by Baltatatum"><br>Furtz said: “I think my form and execution are a bit slow. We lost the game today, and we lost it in an unacceptable way. We need to fix some problems. Now that the game is just beginning, we have time to change it. It’s all about me. I need to reflect and learn from today’s game and move forward.<br>In fact, it’s not just fultz. Today, the magic team is in a slump. In the first half, the shooting percentage of the whole team was only 28.9%, and the first five players scored only 12 points in 4 out of 22 shots.<br>When Aron Gordon talked about the team’s defeat after the game, he warned everyone.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/One in eight scored only three points! The 17-year-old Prime Minister really can't come back. He was completely separated by Baltatatum/e9a75c00c9554db7bd277251b5ff105f.jpg" alt="One in eight scored only three points! The 17-year-old Prime Minister really can&#39;t come back. He was completely separated by Baltatatum"><br>Gordon took everyone, including him, for granted. They are not strong enough to despise their opponents. Gordon believes that today’s game is a good pre-season game, and they have time to adjust when the alarm is sounded.<br>Coach Steve Cliffy is full of anger. When talking about the team’s performance, Cliffy believes that there are too many problems to be solved, such as the fluency of the offensive side, how the defensive side suppresses the ball holder, which the team needs to solve completely in the pre-season.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/One in eight scored only three points! The 17-year-old Prime Minister really can't come back. He was completely separated by Baltatatum/3ed5f010098e4d48a6cec758a07fb841.jpg" alt="One in eight scored only three points! The 17-year-old Prime Minister really can&#39;t come back. He was completely separated by Baltatatum"><br>The Magic got Fultz and wanted to scrape off the scrape. At least they put their hopes on Fultz to raise the team’s cap. From a realistic point of view, Fultz’s strange illness has made him a long way from the top-notch Bauer and the flower detector Tatum.<br>Maybe the first point guard who was unstoppable in the College League really couldn’t come back.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/One in eight scored only three points! The 17-year-old Prime Minister really can't come back. He was completely separated by Baltatatum/e2c5b4114eab4048b36c46f7249f5283.jpg" alt="One in eight scored only three points! The 17-year-old Prime Minister really can&#39;t come back. He was completely separated by Baltatatum"><br>We all know that magic has not been a good way to train players in the past. Basically, few players have become superstars in recent years. Even Auladipo had been sent away, and now they were the backbone of the pedestrians.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Sun’s home game against 76 people, there is still a ban on embid, this game still can not play, 76 people not only just finished the final, but also 5 consecutive wins, ranking first in the East. However, there is no such thing as ebbed’s 76 players. The Suns have been on the fast boat this season, pushing the jazz to the top, and the strength is not weak. In fact, the strength gap between the two teams is not very big. What’s more, the current coach of the Suns, who was an assistant of 76 last season, knows his tactics very well.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/12/One man breaks the whole team! 40 + 4 + 3 + 1 in 15 of 19, his performance is a superstar/cfc6cf89be074813b414afacbabab2ab.jpg" alt="One man breaks the whole team! 40 + 4 + 3 + 1 in 15 of 19, his performance is a superstar"><br>In the first quarter, sun made three mistakes at the beginning of the game, two of which were tackled by Simmons to complete the counterattack, one of which was directly hit on the backboard and then hit back. Harris played inside and outside in a row, and the attack and defense of 76 players at the beginning of the game were very aggressive. But the sun’s own offensive state is very good, ebbed is not in, Baines dominates the 76 people’s inner line, both prevented Simmons, and 3-for-3, got 7 points, Booker and ubre are also in good condition, on the contrary, the 76 people are behind in the score.<br>With one and a half minutes left in the first quarter of the game, the Suns dropped three main players, including Booker, ubre and Rubio. The strength of the team fell in an instant, the attack end was a little stagnant, and the hit rate was not very high. The 76ers seized the opportunity to play a wave, rewriting the score into 31-29, anti super 2 points before the end.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/12/One man breaks the whole team! 40 + 4 + 3 + 1 in 15 of 19, his performance is a superstar/ba27cf041e0447a4ac772d903994190f.jpg" alt="One man breaks the whole team! 40 + 4 + 3 + 1 in 15 of 19, his performance is a superstar"><br>In the next quarter, after Rubio came back, the Suns played more organizationally in the offensive end. When Aubrey and Booker came back, they played very well in tactics and kept aggressive in the offensive end. Suns Baines can’t defend, the 76 man shooting type inside got a lot of opportunities, so the score still can’t open.<br>But after Baines goes down, the sun’s interior line has no height, and the rebounds are continuously exploded. In the second half of the period, 76 people, by virtue of their height advantage, continuously hit the front rebounds and got a lot of second attack opportunities. The sun has no choice but to replace Baines. Although the attack end has a little effect, it’s his own 2 points to let the other side get 4 points. He can only defend under the interior basket, a little bit It’s hard to be a little far away. In the last 3.9 seconds, the 76ers took a three-point lead to six with hofford’s pressure post, and the two sides played 61-55.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/12/One man breaks the whole team! 40 + 4 + 3 + 1 in 15 of 19, his performance is a superstar/5450eafe2af14415945190672d3fbf37.jpg" alt="One man breaks the whole team! 40 + 4 + 3 + 1 in 15 of 19, his performance is a superstar"><br>In the third quarter, the Suns were relatively lax in defense, making the 76ers’ tactics too easy to play, but also to be robbed. Fortunately, Booker came out, scored 9 points in a row, and was sent a three-point ball to assist. Under his series and scoring leadership, and even under the defensive enthusiasm, the Suns kept the momentum of chasing points, barely making up for the disadvantage of the defensive end.<br>In the last four minutes, Booker led a wave of attack climax, even scoring five points to level the score, but the Suns had a problem. Baines and Booker got their fourth foul in two rounds, and had to leave early. The Suns put five substitutes on the court, while the 76ers had Simmons, hofford, Ennis and Harris, but the array Rong didn’t play as well as he did in the first half, but was caught by the Suns’ substitutes. The Suns once surpassed 76. At the end of the third quarter, the 76ers led the Suns 82-81 by one point.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/12/One man breaks the whole team! 40 + 4 + 3 + 1 in 15 of 19, his performance is a superstar/eb9fb220688e49bcaec26d72ee165fcd.jpg" alt="One man breaks the whole team! 40 + 4 + 3 + 1 in 15 of 19, his performance is a superstar"><br>At the end of the game, Rubio played with Baines and the substitutes, with rebounding protection, internal defense, external organization, and the Suns’ attack was very smooth. On the contrary, there was no Simmons and Harris on the 76ers’ side, and it was a bit difficult for hofford to play. Within four minutes, the Suns exceeded the points by seven.<br>When the main players of both sides came back, the Suns scored two waves at both ends of attack and defense, playing 76 players in minutes. After the pause, Horford made a continuous effort to equalise the score in a short time. In the last three minutes, the 76ers carried out a high-intensity bag defense on Booker, but they still failed to prevent Booker’s difficult shot and the coming out of ubre. The Suns beat the 76ers 114-109, ending their five straight wins.<br>In the whole game, the three of the 76ers scored 20 points, and hofford’s efficiency was very high. He scored 32 points in 13 of 20 shots, Harris scored 24 points and 10 rebounds, Simmons didn’t play well, and his defensive performance was excellent, but in other aspects, he played lower than his normal level, mainly because he could not play Baines, his self-confidence was fluctuated, and he made 4 mistakes in 6 + 5 + 6 + 7 steals.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/12/One man breaks the whole team! 40 + 4 + 3 + 1 in 15 of 19, his performance is a superstar/1ec50c7899814aa4a34bb9a626d38567.jpg" alt="One man breaks the whole team! 40 + 4 + 3 + 1 in 15 of 19, his performance is a superstar"><br>On the sun’s side, Booker stood out in the third quarter of the game. He and the whole team of 76 people fought against each other. He scored 16 points in 7-for-6 of a single quarter. In the fourth quarter of the game, the king came back. Under the high-intensity clamps of 76 people, he was able to score many difficult goals. He got 11 points and 1 assists. In the whole game, he shot 15 of 19, 3 of 3, 4-for-3. His efficiency was very high. He got 40 points, 4 rebounds, 3 assists and 1 Block a Shot.<br>Last time ended the clipper’s winning streak, this time ended the 76 people’s winning streak, the Suns, rob the rich and help the poor, stone hammer!</p>

    <title>Players with 3-win and 2-MVP are not recognized Warrior Celebrity Fury Expert You must be crazy</title>
    <url>/2019/08/24/Players%20with%203-win%20and%202-MVP%20are%20not%20recognized%20Warrior%20Celebrity%20Fury%20Expert%20You%20must%20be%20crazy/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/24/Players with 3-win and 2-MVP are not recognized Warrior Celebrity Fury Expert You must be crazy/c827efc6e4af43bf88205338a12e53e1.jpg" alt="Players with 3-win and 2-MVP are not recognized Warrior Celebrity Fury Expert You must be crazy"><br>​<br>“Watching a program recently really drives me crazy. Damon Jones and Hollins… For these two people, my God, I think there should be a rule not to let players who can’t get 10 or 20 points per game in their career or any season comment on the game on TV, and people who can’t get 10 or 20 points per game comment on the game. I don’t know what the program wants to express.<br>It’s a famous warrior. Stephen Jackson, once a famous “sage of war”, denounced the remarks of television specialists in his social media.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/24/Players with 3-win and 2-MVP are not recognized Warrior Celebrity Fury Expert You must be crazy/e0e1a4190f15438085a1c4f7959691b6.jpg" alt="Players with 3-win and 2-MVP are not recognized Warrior Celebrity Fury Expert You must be crazy"><br>​<br>So what topic did these so-called experts discuss? Damon Jones and Hollins, both former NBA players, recently joined ESPN’s more famous talk show First Take and then discussed who needs to prove themselves in the new season, Stephen Cooley and James Harden.<br>In the show, Damon Jones thought that Curie needed to prove himself more than James Harden, which annoyed Stephen Jackson, a warrior. He shouted angrily, “Come on, Curie has three champions and has won two MVPs. What else does he need to prove? Harden hasn’t won the championship yet. Why does Curie need to prove himself more than Harden?<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/24/Players with 3-win and 2-MVP are not recognized Warrior Celebrity Fury Expert You must be crazy/dcc13500aef94d09931ad19384004b5b.jpg" alt="Players with 3-win and 2-MVP are not recognized Warrior Celebrity Fury Expert You must be crazy"><br>​<br>Stephen Jackson’s remarks are offensive. He also mentioned the average score of players. In fact, in ESPN programs, there are always former NBA players and even big stars to participate in the discussion. Some Hall of Fame players such as Pippen and McGrady are also frequent guests.<br>However, Hollins and Damon Jones have to go a little further according to Jackson’s criteria. Hollis has only scored 3.7 points per game in his career, and no season has scored more than 10 points per game.<br>Damon Jones, by contrast, scored an average of 6.6 points in his career and 11.6 points in the 2004-2005 season for the Heat.<br>Of course, it does not mean that if the NBA does not play well, it must not understand the ball, which is also linked to physical fitness, playing characteristics.<br>But in the NBA to play an average of more than 20 points, it has touched the threshold of stars, this level of stars, must be online players and physical fitness, some players even the combination of the top, so we can go to the super-giant road.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/24/Players with 3-win and 2-MVP are not recognized Warrior Celebrity Fury Expert You must be crazy/d4ed363806b946cca14c3550f06a1f17.jpg" alt="Players with 3-win and 2-MVP are not recognized Warrior Celebrity Fury Expert You must be crazy"><br>​<br>Then the problem returned to Curie and Harden, who scored 23.5 points in his career and averaged 30.1 points, 5.4 rebounds and 6.7 assists in the 15-16 season of his peak season, with 180 clubs’shooting percentage per game. In addition, he led the league with 2.1 steals per game and was elected the first full-vote MVP in history.<br>Last season, Harden had scored the only season since the amalgamation of NBA and ABA. Michael Jordan scored 36.1 points per game. He was the top scorer in the last four seasons. His terrible scoring ability has been selected by the players’Union as the most defensive player in the League for several seasons.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/24/Players with 3-win and 2-MVP are not recognized Warrior Celebrity Fury Expert You must be crazy/74372d6c769c4fc0a1c8c58a151d7d6a.jpg" alt="Players with 3-win and 2-MVP are not recognized Warrior Celebrity Fury Expert You must be crazy"><br>​<br>So both players have already won MVP, and then we have to discuss in the program whether we need to continue to prove ourselves?<br>More horrible, as a master of the age of small ball, Curie has led the Warriors to the finals five times in a row in the fierce competition in the West, and won three championships in five years. However, such a Curie in people’s eyes is not a proof of himself? It’s really some exaggeration.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/24/Players with 3-win and 2-MVP are not recognized Warrior Celebrity Fury Expert You must be crazy/502307837122495ab5e29a8446ab9f48.jpg" alt="Players with 3-win and 2-MVP are not recognized Warrior Celebrity Fury Expert You must be crazy"><br>​<br>Of course, what the program needs is the topic, even if the guests did not want to release along the way, but the answer to the question of who needs to prove themselves more in Curie and Harden is foolish no matter who chooses. MVP players don’t need to prove themselves to anyone. They’ve proven it with their results.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The 76ers continued their journey away from home. This time, they challenged the jazz of the western strong team, and ebbed was back. He was the core player who helped the 76ers to regain their momentum. Jazz lost to Clippers in the last game, but Mitchell scored high and got better and better, while Conley’s state is still a ticking bomb. Whether he plays well or not has a lot to do with the trend of the game.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/03/Reversal failed! He cut 27 + 16 + 3 + 2 + 3 in 35 minutes, and he couldn't take 76 free throws 18 times/a4f5b6dd87f9499db86a6760ce27bba5.jpg" alt="Reversal failed! He cut 27 + 16 + 3 + 2 + 3 in 35 minutes, and he couldn&#39;t take 76 free throws 18 times"><br>In the first quarter of the game, ebbed was caught holding the ball in the first round, showing the focus and intensity of jazz defense. Ebbed had a lot of ball rights in the start, but he was the best defensive player himself, and there were still people in the low post, so ebbed didn’t get a good mobile conference. The Jazz started with Conley’s attack, but the effect was not very good. Mitchell took over the ball right later. He shot four times for four shots, three of which were shot in the middle simply with the help of cover, and ebbed stayed in the three second zone, basically unable to come out.<br>In the rotation stage, the Jazz first replaced Mitchell, who was in good condition, and let Conley lead the team. When Mitchell came back in the last three minutes, the 76 man netto strengthened the defense around Mitchell, which was very effective for Mitchell’s entanglement. In the face of netto, Mitchell missed three shots. The 76ers found their hand outside the three-point line and scored three three-point goals, surpassing the score in one fell swoop. After the first battle, the 76ers and the Jazz fought 29-26.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/03/Reversal failed! He cut 27 + 16 + 3 + 2 + 3 in 35 minutes, and he couldn't take 76 free throws 18 times/dfcb818c5a4f49469eae8d74e41cbe7c.jpg" alt="Reversal failed! He cut 27 + 16 + 3 + 2 + 3 in 35 minutes, and he couldn&#39;t take 76 free throws 18 times"><br>In the next quarter, the Jazz beat gobel, Bradley played against ebbed. Obviously, the 76ers had the upper hand in all aspects, so the 76ers played almost every round with ebbed. When ebbed was in the low post and deep inside, the Jazz couldn’t defend him, but there was a problem in the outside line. Moreover, after ebbed played four rounds in a row, he was frantically entrapped by the Jazz team. Harris was idle as an offensive strength. There was a problem in the attack of the 76ers. Braun replaced ebbed in the next round.<br>Harris regained the ball right after a cool period of time, but the hit rate was very low. On the contrary, the 76 players were bombed continuously by Bogdanovic and gobel because they did not have embid in the interior, and the two teams drew 46. In the second half of the game, Simmons didn’t play because of a shoulder injury, and ebbed led the bench alone. There was no hofford or Harris, but he was in a sawing position with the jazz. At the end of half-time, the two sides were 56-58, and the 76ers were 2 points behind.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/03/Reversal failed! He cut 27 + 16 + 3 + 2 + 3 in 35 minutes, and he couldn't take 76 free throws 18 times/78e3f717688e4b28af1779842b63b036.jpg" alt="Reversal failed! He cut 27 + 16 + 3 + 2 + 3 in 35 minutes, and he couldn&#39;t take 76 free throws 18 times"><br>In the third quarter, without Simmons, the attack of the 76ers was a little simple. Harris still didn’t find his hand. There was not much chance for enbid. Hofford couldn’t make it in four consecutive rounds, and the 76ers fell into the scoring shortage. Mitchell played aggressively and hit a high percentage on the Jazz side. Conley also found the form. He had three-point shooting on the outside and three-point shooting on the inside. In half a quarter, the Jazz pulled the difference to 11 points.<br>In the second half of the third quarter, ebbed came back to lead the substitutes, but the attacking end of the 76ers was not good. First of all, ebbed played very simply, facing gobel’s defensive shooting from a long distance, or holding the ball at a low position was sandwiched. Jazz’s defense caused great trouble to the 76ers, because they didn’t have the guard like Simmons to handle the ball and create opportunities, although Richardson And netted two non chance three-point goals, but the difference at the end of the three quarters was stabilized at 11 points.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/03/Reversal failed! He cut 27 + 16 + 3 + 2 + 3 in 35 minutes, and he couldn't take 76 free throws 18 times/7308637d63fc427c9382d8d74aedf28e.jpg" alt="Reversal failed! He cut 27 + 16 + 3 + 2 + 3 in 35 minutes, and he couldn&#39;t take 76 free throws 18 times"><br>At the end of the game, Harris strengthened his personal attack, although the efficiency was not particularly high, but at least recovered some feelings. He scored 10 points in a row to help the 76ers get close to the score, but when the Jazz team gobel came back, Harris would be a little difficult to attack the inside line again. Moreover, after enbid came back, the attack power of the 76ers concentrated on him, and Harris got more opportunities It’s hard.<br>In the last five minutes of the last quarter, ebbed finally scored in the second half. It was difficult to get two chances in the small circle of the forbidden area. When Mitchell came up from the Jazz side, he didn’t score twice in a row. Conley couldn’t score, and the difference was reduced to 4 points. At the last critical moment, Mitchell missed two shots, but the 76ers failed to seize the chance, and Richardson’s one mistake directly ruined the game.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/03/Reversal failed! He cut 27 + 16 + 3 + 2 + 3 in 35 minutes, and he couldn't take 76 free throws 18 times/ab983ad568f94e73b446ff20a22a4c06.jpg" alt="Reversal failed! He cut 27 + 16 + 3 + 2 + 3 in 35 minutes, and he couldn&#39;t take 76 free throws 18 times"><br>In the whole game, the two sides played 106-104. Gobel was sent off for six fouls. He got 14 + 16 + 3 + 3 for 4 of 8 shots. Harris, Horford and enbid didn’t play well because of the interference of gobel in the interior line and good defense. Conley found the form in this game, although the hit rate is not high, 15 points, but plus or minus + 19. Mitchell played well in the first three quarters. In the fourth quarter, the hand fell and the whole game got 24 + 5 + 8. The reason why Jazz can win is the overall defense and team attack.<br>76 people because of Simon’s injury, leading to the team’s organizational offensive play is very bad, in the connection of the game there are a lot of offensive problems. Hofford scored only 7 points in 4 of 13. Embid played 35 minutes, 5 of 16 shots, 1 of 3-pointers, 5 of 5. The hit rate was very low, but he missed 18 times, got 27 points, 16 rebounds, 3 assists, 2 blocks and 3 mistakes. He lost in the first game since he came back. It was very difficult for embid and Simmons to win if they left.</p>

    <title>Plus or minus up to + 19! 6 + 5 + 1 in the last 12 minutes. The Lakers really got the treasure</title>
    <url>/2019/11/06/Plus%20or%20minus%20up%20to%20+%2019!%206%20+%205%20+%201%20in%20the%20last%2012%20minutes.%20The%20Lakers%20really%20got%20the%20treasure/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In these three games, the Lakers have three things in common. First, James has three doubles. Second, Kuzma is back. Third, Howard has played 12 minutes in the last game. In the end, the Lakers have all reversed.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/06/Plus or minus up to + 19! 6 + 5 + 1 in the last 12 minutes. The Lakers really got the treasure/48a1169ab27c429d8ab2a5b389146891.jpg" alt="Plus or minus up to + 19! 6 + 5 + 1 in the last 12 minutes. The Lakers really got the treasure"><br>In the game with the bulls, Vogel continued the pattern of the first two games, let Kuzma go up first and partner with bushmei. Although we all know that Howard’s effect is much better, in order to let Kuzma integrate into the game and slowly adapt to the rhythm of the game, Vogel still risked a lot of playing time for Kuzma, let him find the rhythm, to establish contact with bushmei 。<br>As in the first two games, the Lakers’ starting line-up is in a hole. Kutz was not good after coming. He had no hand feeling. He couldn’t find his own position. He also made mistakes. The Lakers didn’t defend, and the offensive end was in a state of stagnation. He was once beaten under pressure.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/06/Plus or minus up to + 19! 6 + 5 + 1 in the last 12 minutes. The Lakers really got the treasure/fff7dba506a34738bc74d4f367be7230.jpg" alt="Plus or minus up to + 19! 6 + 5 + 1 in the last 12 minutes. The Lakers really got the treasure"><br>Howard didn’t do much after coming up in the second quarter. It’s not for Howard’s personal reasons, it’s for the Lakers. First of all, the Lakers frequently make mistakes in the offensive end, tactical confusion, no positional warfare, almost all turn back running. Howard even has difficulty in passing the ball and even touching the ball. Secondly, the defense of his teammates was a bit bad. Howard wiped his teammates’ buttocks for many times under the basket, so he had two fouls early, and he also played very hard. From Howard’s performance, he felt angry for his failure to defend his opponent. It can be seen that he has a high demand for himself. The game is very competitive and hard-working. This desire to win is what we want to see and what the Lakers lack.<br>Howard played 9 minutes in the second quarter of the game, without any data, 0 shots, 0 rebounds, 0 assists, 0 steals, 0 blocks, just like he didn’t play, but the positive and negative values were - 13. Howard played only three minutes in the third quarter, helping the team chase points with James.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/06/Plus or minus up to + 19! 6 + 5 + 1 in the last 12 minutes. The Lakers really got the treasure/50ff6e4f699641d4af492d1291bf5281.jpg" alt="Plus or minus up to + 19! 6 + 5 + 1 in the last 12 minutes. The Lakers really got the treasure"><br>The real turning point in the fourth quarter, led by Kuzma to a wave of offensive climax, the Lakers played a wave of 16-0, of which Howard’s credit is not small. In this game, Howard played 12 minutes, 4-for-3, got 6 points, 5 rebounds and 1 block, with a positive and negative value of + 19 in a single quarter. When the Lakers entered the fourth quarter, they were 13 points behind. When James came back, Howard and Kuzma had already reversed the score by more than 1 point, and the momentum of the game had been reversed.<br>Howard’s contributions include scoring the second attack after grabbing the rebounds in the front court, getting the card under the basket and receiving the pass from his teammates, James playing the singles on one side, Howard waiting for the chance to run and receive the ball and lay up. It can be seen that Howard doesn’t care about the ball right, but he has been looking for opportunities and is very positive. This is due to more than ten years of experience in the game, which can not be practiced overnight.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/06/Plus or minus up to + 19! 6 + 5 + 1 in the last 12 minutes. The Lakers really got the treasure/06dedf0467f4442ba50ab2816c58ba24.jpg" alt="Plus or minus up to + 19! 6 + 5 + 1 in the last 12 minutes. The Lakers really got the treasure"><br>Howard’s defense is the fundamental reason for the Lakers to win the game. It’s also the reason for the Lakers to win three consecutive away games, or even the latest six consecutive wins.<br>The game 9:40 seconds, the Lakers behind 6 points, Kuzma missed the penalty basket, Howard grabbed the rebound to play 2 points. Looking back, bulls guard white didn’t play a single against Kuzma, but went to Howard to play again, which was the most wrong decision he made in this game. Howard has been defending in front of white from the three-point line without losing his position. When he rushed to the restricted area for layup, Howard directly gave him a big cap and fanned out the bottom line. White then made another three-point Miss against Howard’s defense. Before the end, the Lakers fought back. Howard wanted to be in the position under the basket. Cook gave the ball quickly. Howard played a 2 + 1. These two attacks and one defense directly broke the bull at both ends of the attack and defense and dominated the interior line!<br>If we don’t have Howard’s defense, the Lakers may be able to win by James. But with Howard’s defense, the Lakers can fight back much more efficiently. The most important thing is that Howard’s defense performance can inspire teammates to take out the best defense attitude, form an atmosphere, and change the atmosphere. There are only people in the Lakers Howard.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/06/Plus or minus up to + 19! 6 + 5 + 1 in the last 12 minutes. The Lakers really got the treasure/a1cb33dc63bb4124b7719819de19c6ef.jpg" alt="Plus or minus up to + 19! 6 + 5 + 1 in the last 12 minutes. The Lakers really got the treasure"><br>Looking back on the off-season, Howard accepted the Lakers’ non guaranteed base salary contract with the lowest attitude, which was questioned and criticized by many fans. Now it seems that the Lakers really found the treasure, don’t worry about any of his problems, or even seamless connection with James and bushmei on the court. Therefore, the Lakers fans gave Howard a nickname: Huo Zhenxiang!<br>According to reports after the game, Howard went to practice again after the game. A player’s attitude can really determine a lot of things.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Trailblazers challenge clippers away. The last clipper lost to bucks, Leonard was questioned by the outside media and reporters because of his rotation. This game was announced, the lineup is relatively complete, and the overall strength will be greatly increased. The Blazers lost to the warriors in the last game, which is a disgrace to a strong western team. Therefore, the Blazers management attached great importance to the game and came to the scene to watch.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/02/Reverse the game! 27 + 13 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 6, he finally stood out in the fourth quarter/1fbcd724c3b4490fbc795e93d08ab14a.jpg" alt="Reverse the game! 27 + 13 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 6, he finally stood out in the fourth quarter"><br>In the first quarter of the game, Lillard started with a 3 + 1 score of 4 points, and Hu De also made three-point shots from the outside, but this didn’t let the Blazers play the attack wave of the outside, because the first three goals of the Blazers were all obtained through the middle and long-distance projection, and the breakthrough of the inside line was either to play iron or to be robbed. The defense strength of the front line and the inside line of the Clippers was very strong, which didn’t give the Blazers a chance. At the same time, zubates grabbed three rebounds in the front court. The Clippers didn’t play very well at the offensive end, but they played very actively. From the preparation of the game, the clippers were better.<br>In the rotation phase, the Clippers changed to Harrell and Ludwig, and the trailblazers left Lillard on the field. Luwei relies on his strong scoring ability to score continuously by making fouls and flying jump shots, but Lillard is not so easy to score. The clippers have a strong defense on Lillard, trying to force him out of the ball. Two under the basket breakthrough shots can’t be scored, once by the blood cap, once by the interference, once by the cover and also by the snatch. Leonard came back in the last minute to play two attacks but didn’t touch the ball. In the first quarter, both sides played 26-22, and the Blazers were 4 points behind.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/02/Reverse the game! 27 + 13 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 6, he finally stood out in the fourth quarter/74139ed941c0460790d2f2db4c771f03.jpg" alt="Reverse the game! 27 + 13 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 6, he finally stood out in the fourth quarter"><br>In the next quarter, Leonard brought Harrell and Luwei on the court, while the trailblazer’s backup team only had a slightly stronger scoring point like hood, which was originally the opportunity for the clippers, but Leonard made two mistakes in the opening game, and it took three minutes to open the score to 8 points. McCollam was the first to return to the field, but the pioneer’s attack did not improve much, the difference between the two sides remained at 5 points, and fell into the iron fight.<br>Throughout the second quarter of the game, the attack rhythm of the two teams was a bit stagnant, there were too many fouls and many mistakes. Relying on zubates’s hard work and positive defensive attitude under the basket, the Clippers almost blew up Whiteside, who led the team to score. In the last three minutes, the Blazers worked hard to score several goals. At the end of half-time, the two sides were 40-47, and the Blazers were 7 points behind. For the two attacking teams, the score was a little ugly.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/02/Reverse the game! 27 + 13 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 6, he finally stood out in the fourth quarter/d0ce44442d0a48e794cfe4c95230f712.jpg" alt="Reverse the game! 27 + 13 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 6, he finally stood out in the fourth quarter"><br>In the third quarter of the game, Leonard’s condition was still not found. The substitute took a rest off the court with two guns, relying on zubates to stabilize the rhythm at both ends of the attack and defense. Mccullham opened up in the first half of the game. Although he didn’t score three points, he scored two very stable points. After playing half a game, he scored 12 points, equalizing the score.<br>After the Clippers replaced Leonard and zubates, there was no height in the inner line. Lillard made several consecutive attacks on the inner line, and the difference was quickly surpassed by the Blazers to 6 points, and Luwei and Harrell were unable to control the scene on the court. At the end of the three quarters, the Blazers and Clippers played 76-70.<br>At the end of the game, Leonard came up and scored two goals in the free throw line, but he still didn’t make the shot outside the three-point line, and the state was not fully opened. Relying on Luwei and the breakthrough score, the clipper kept approaching the score. But the pioneer side strange soldier has played the role, the young general Simmons has scored four goals in a row, has scored 10 points to stabilize the difference.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/02/Reverse the game! 27 + 13 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 6, he finally stood out in the fourth quarter/436e2efa4cbf4d76aa0aa211302e8231.jpg" alt="Reverse the game! 27 + 13 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 6, he finally stood out in the fourth quarter"><br>The clipper’s whole game’s outside line hit rate is very bad, Leonard and Luwei can’t throw in, so Leonard increased the impact of the inside line in the last five minutes, was sandwiched and gave the ball to Harrell, the effect is good, once the score to 1 point. In the last three minutes, Leonard and Luwei hit three goals in a row near the free throw line through the play and pick tactics. Then they turned to Beverly to defend Lillard and forced him out. The clipper pulled the difference to four points by the three-point shot of attack and defense conversion and Luwei, which basically killed the game.<br>At the end of the game, the two sides played 101-107. Leonard made 9 of 23 shots, 27 points, 13 rebounds, 4 assists, 1 steals, 2 blocks and 6 mistakes. Leonard played very badly in the first three quarters, made a lot of mistakes, and hit a low percentage. In the whole game, he shot 0-for-5 in three-point shots. In the fourth quarter, he worked hard and helped the Clippers to score points through the mid-range jump shot. In the last quarter, he played 12 minutes, got 18 points, 6 rebounds and 1 assists, with a positive and negative value of + 12 in a single quarter. Of course, the key goal to win the game in the end is the three-point shooting from the outside line of Ludwig against the defense. Ludwig is still the “father” of the Clippers.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/02/Reverse the game! 27 + 13 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 6, he finally stood out in the fourth quarter/1e29033528ed497e8f70efc214f05ac7.jpg" alt="Reverse the game! 27 + 13 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 6, he finally stood out in the fourth quarter"><br>On the pioneer’s side, Lillard and McCollam also made 9 of 23 shots, and they also got 22 points. They also didn’t open their hands on the three-point ball. McCollam made 1 of 6 three-point shots, and Lillard made 3 of 10 three-point shots. It can be said that whoever scored three points in the final moment of the game will win the game. Luwei did it and the Blazers failed to do it.</p>

Today, the Jedi survived, and the Jazz won the away victory.<br>In both matches, the Jazz took the initiative to change the lineup to a smaller size, which could increase the mobility of the lineup and add an extra threat from the outside.<br>And the Jazz just put one Gerber on the court, and their inside advantage is enough. Gobel and Feivos take turns to ensure that the line-up continues to be high enough.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/27/Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D'Antoni's strategy was wrong/197ada384577439cab545007d1f31107.jpg" alt="Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D&#39;Antoni&#39;s strategy was wrong"><br>​<br>Claude, who won the trust in the last game, did not disappoint. If the emotional player starts well, his threat will run through the game.<br>Claude’s performance in the previous two games was not so good. Today, in the first quarter, he broke through by three points and fired up completely. In the first quarter, he scored 14 points, which exceeded the total score in the previous two games.<br>Claude’s outbreak was also justified. Jazz’s performance outside the three-point line in this series is not good. Their adjustment in this series is to pass the ball more patiently and find the best chance to try another three-point.<br>The ball-holder uses more blocking and disassembling to kill the inside line, or uses Extra Pass to mobilize more rocket defense on the outside line, and finally finds an excellent opportunity.<br>Claude’s three points and lay-up in the first quarter are excellent opportunities for this kind of Extra Pass to export, and Claude also grasped them better. So the Jazz took a good lead.<br>The Jazz’s defense has also obviously improved.<br>Harden’s feel is still hot, but at least the Jazz’s breakthrough against Harden was the best one in the game. In particular, Gobel’s top defense and the other players’underhand pulls interfere with passing, or follow-up blockade to block Capella.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/27/Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D'Antoni's strategy was wrong/316b53dfc3bb46bbbb77fbd6aca90498.jpg" alt="Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D&#39;Antoni&#39;s strategy was wrong"><br>​<br>In addition, the Jazz’s first success in this game should be Mitchell, who broke out in desperation.<br>His outbreak at the beginning of the fourth quarter helped the team reverse the decline of the third quarter. Together with the home momentum and the rocket’s failure, the victory was firmly in the bag.<br>But the hero behind the game is Coach Schneider. Several of his decisions in this game are quite sensible.<br>For example, after half-time Ingers did not work well, the Jazz basically abandoned Ingers in the second half.<br>O’Neill has been playing a more defensive role in restricting Harden, and his breakthroughs and three points at the offensive end are also quite threatening.<br>And in the middle of the most anxious fourth quarter, the Rockets did not choose Capella, and Schneider did suddenly replace Gobel in the remaining four minutes of the game.<br>After Fervus replaced him, three consecutive rounds of front rebounds in the period of 3 minutes to 2 minutes, and two consecutive rounds of follow-up after Mitchell’s lay-up dunks, were regarded as completely killing the suspense of the game.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/27/Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D'Antoni's strategy was wrong/d262194ee890485f98544e35aaf13620.jpg" alt="Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D&#39;Antoni&#39;s strategy was wrong"><br>​<br>The Jazz had a huge rebound advantage in this game. The Rockets’small team even used Harden to play five main defenses against Gobel. In this case, the Jazz rebounded more than 17 Rockets throughout the game.<br>A famous Japanese center, Akira Gangxian, once said, “The person who controls the rebound can control the game.”<br>And this game, Mitchell’s fourth quarter start is the momentum, killing the game, it is the Rockets can not grab the front rebound and can not hold back the backcourt rebound.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/27/Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D'Antoni's strategy was wrong/e285fb2c2be7407bb2dbfcce32408ad3.jpg" alt="Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D&#39;Antoni&#39;s strategy was wrong"><br>​</p>

At one point in half time, the rocket had a 50% hit rate.<br>In this game, Tucker and Gordon felt quite hot outside the three-point line, but in the crucial fourth quarter, the Rockets’three-point power was suddenly cut off. The blackout was inexplicable and fatal.<br>From the end of the third quarter to the beginning of the fourth quarter, the Rockets lost 12 consecutive points, which seems to be returning to the dead cycle of last season’s Western Finals G7.<br>The Jazz’s outburst disrupted the Rockets’rhythm, and then the Rockets were eager to chase points, forcing the shot to miss three points.<br>The Jazz chased back and scored again. The Rockets threw a three-point miss again. After several consecutive rounds, the game was over.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/27/Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D'Antoni's strategy was wrong/4a8b5e87e2954283993a8aef76e80b87.jpg" alt="Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D&#39;Antoni&#39;s strategy was wrong"><br>​<br>Of course, throughout the fourth quarter, Paul, the only rocket, remained awake.<br>Paul’s fourth quarter stealing and fouling almost broke the Jazz’s momentum. But since then, the rocket is still obsessed with three points, not in a row, too impatient.<br>In that small lineup, the Rockets can hardly rebound themselves if they miss only three points.<br>In retrospect, the Rockets’defensive problems, as well as their inability to protect their own rebounds, offense can not be prevented, the game can not be played naturally.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/27/Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D'Antoni's strategy was wrong/f38f0e5deaca42e48a3a8c2d7a5de9ac.jpg" alt="Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D&#39;Antoni&#39;s strategy was wrong"><br>​</p>
<h1 id="Decision-making-Errors-of-D’Antoni"><a href="#Decision-making-Errors-of-D’Antoni" class="headerlink" title="** Decision-making Errors of D’Antoni**"></a>** Decision-making Errors of D’Antoni**</h1><p>As for the decision-making of section IV, it is worth discussing. For example, the use of Gerald Green by D’Antoni at the beginning of the fourth section.<br>We have seen the performance of Gerard Green in this series. The first three points are 1, the second one is 0, the third five is 3, and today the fourth one is 2.0. It’s too unstable.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/27/Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D'Antoni's strategy was wrong/887738b9b47c4ebaad15796daa2b027e.jpg" alt="Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D&#39;Antoni&#39;s strategy was wrong"><br>​<br>Such an unstable shooter, however, scored two consecutive, somewhat impatient three points at the beginning of the fourth quarter. The Jazz’s 7-0 was played in these two three-point rounds.<br>The use of Green is more like a double-edged sword, sometimes extremely sharp, see the throat, sometimes, may also hurt themselves.<br>Just after Jazz started 7-0, D’Antoni immediately replaced Green with House. That is to say, D’Antoni himself denied his choice of rotation.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/27/Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D'Antoni's strategy was wrong/7a4d47c1a6e74cfc8eec21577ab792d8.jpg" alt="Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D&#39;Antoni&#39;s strategy was wrong"><br>​<br>Another decision-making mistake is related to the rotation of Fervus and Capella.<br>Fevos has a big advantage against the small team. Although Tucker can squeeze out the position, the gap between Tucker and Fevos is too big. The Rockets’collective protection of rebounds as a whole is also somewhat arbitrary.<br>D’Antoni replaced Capella so slowly that the Rockets could not get rebounds and had missed the best chance to chase points.<br>Because of Mitchell’s good condition, the Jazz beat Mitchell and Fervus to the death. Fervus was more flexible to follow up, and repeatedly followed up when Capella chased Mitchell to make up the basket.<br>In fact, it was Fervus’three consecutive rounds of front rebounds and the rocket’s out-of-bounds, the baseline ball followed by the air-cut hoop buckle, and the two subsequent buckles after the block and tear down, which almost locked the game in.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/27/Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D'Antoni's strategy was wrong/e3eeb07c874b4ca394aea48bbb497455.jpg" alt="Rocket Sir VS G4 The Jazz in the small lineup had the upper hand, and D&#39;Antoni&#39;s strategy was wrong"><br>​<br>Salt Lake City people are stubborn and resilient, and their will to fight in the last two games is admirable. Today’s Jazz team is certainly the more deserving side.<br>But the series results are still cold 3-1, rockets occupy an absolute advantage, the Jazz came to the Rockets home can play this backwater momentum is not yet clear.<br>The initiative to end the series is still in the hands of the Rockets, but the Rockets need to be more serious and put more effort into it.</p>

    <title>Seven people scored double! Melly, representing the 28 Pelicans showdown team, first talked about the NBA in Zion I really don&#39;t have pressure</title>
    <url>/2019/10/14/Seven%20people%20scored%20double!%20Melly,%20representing%20the%2028%20Pelicans%20showdown%20team,%20first%20talked%20about%20the%20NBA%20in%20Zion%20I%20really%20don&#39;t%20have%20pressure/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>At the end of today’s pre-season game, the Pelican won four consecutive games with 123-114 Rick Spurs away. Yes, the pelican got Ingram and Bauer in the Davis deal this summer, and the presence of the two leaders strengthened the talent of the pelican. Plus the pelican took Zion Williams with the first prize tag.<br>It’s an emperor star with James’s tough body and O’Neill’s average weight. In previous preseason games, it was a perfect demonstration of dominance for everyone.<br>In the last game, Zion broke the league’s first defense against Utah, Gerber, and scored five goals in six rounds against him. Today, facing the hot Spurs, Popovich has nothing to do with him.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Seven people scored double! Melly, representing the 28 Pelicans showdown team, first talked about the NBA in Zion I really don't have pressure/2b087fe248f44e7f84f000aede541c64.jpg" alt="Seven people scored double! Melly, representing the 28 Pelicans showdown team, first talked about the NBA in Zion I really don&#39;t have pressure"><br>Zion’s performance in the third quarter shattered the Spurs. Because the Spurs felt so good in the first half today, Forbes incarnated in Kuri in the first quarter, first hitting 3 + 1, then hitting a difficult three-point goal. Spurs are in full bloom in the first quarter under three minutes of rain. The Pelican side only relies on Holiday and Zion to maintain the score difference, with the Spurs leading the Pelican by 11 points in the first quarter.<br>In the second quarter, the Spurs kept on scoring and Ingram responded. The two sides were caught in a tug-of-war, and the Spurs continued to lead by 10 points at 66-56 at half-time. But we all know that the first fat is not fat, the Spurs attack is not hot the whole game.<br>In the second half, the pelican finally offered a trump card killing. The delicate connection between Zion and Bauer made the pelican blow a counter-attack horn like mercury.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Seven people scored double! Melly, representing the 28 Pelicans showdown team, first talked about the NBA in Zion I really don't have pressure/1dca0a3e40e9413bb2406693fb386bcf.jpg" alt="Seven people scored double! Melly, representing the 28 Pelicans showdown team, first talked about the NBA in Zion I really don&#39;t have pressure"><br>Zion received many shots from Bauer under the basket. Although he was less than 2 meters tall, he weighed 129 kilograms horribly. Under the basket, Zion turned around and buttocked, and the defender could not stop it. Zion is like Shaquille O’Neal who used to give Popovich a headache. By virtue of his excellent physical qualities, he caused frequent killings in the interior.<br>In the middle of the third section, Zion also comes with an empty button with a leaky side. The Pelican has equalized the 10-point difference. However, Zion was still reluctant and scored another four points under the Spurs basket.<br>The pelican, led by Zion, fired a 16-2 attack wave, but the Spurs were nine points behind at the end of the third quarter.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Seven people scored double!

Melly, representing the 28 Pelicans showdown team, first talked about the NBA in Zion I really don&#39;t have pressure"><br>The Spurs’morale is not in the fourth quarter. Pelican side Moore, Jackson and Walker fight more bravely. Popovich wielded all his troops and won four consecutive victories. The Pelican seems to be losing Davis’s strength, but it’s getting stronger and stronger. The seven pelicans scored double in the game. They are hopeful to be in the playoffs next season, and Zion, a strong team in the West, has changed everything.<br>Perhaps Zion, like James and Duncan, will be at its peak when it comes out, and then it will be at its peak for more than a decade. Today, Zion fought for 30 minutes at 8 in 11, with 22 points and 10 board support. The team’s boss Hollerdy also cut 16 points, Walker 13 points, Bauer 12 points and Ingram 10 points.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Seven people scored double!

Melly, representing the 28 Pelicans showdown team, first talked about the NBA in Zion I really don&#39;t have pressure"><br>Nicole Melly, who spoke to the media after the game, talked about the current pelican. Merry thinks Zion is the first weapon of the pelican, and others under his leadership have fully demonstrated their strength. Speaking about the League situation, Melly believes they will shock the other 28 teams next season.<br>Why 28 teams? Because one team has been removed, the other 29 teams are innocent.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Seven people scored double! Melly, representing the 28 Pelicans showdown team, first talked about the NBA in Zion I really don't have pressure/5b394ed2d0104f05909e8da6375a3bad.jpg" alt="Seven people scored double! Melly, representing the 28 Pelicans showdown team, first talked about the NBA in Zion I really don&#39;t have pressure"><br>It is worth mentioning that Zion also talked about his performance in the NBA pre-season after the game, including the Spurs today. A reporter asked Zion, do you think the NBA League will put pressure on you?<br>“Ah, pressure? I haven’t felt too much pressure in these preseasons, including today’s Spurs. I just learn from the experience of the game, enjoy it and try to win it! “<br>Horizontal ah, it’s too horizontal. To tell you the truth, James may not be as good as Zion in terms of strength and physical confrontation alone. Because Ziontai is so strong. It weighs 129 kilograms and has such speed and explosive power.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Seven people scored double! Melly, representing the 28 Pelicans showdown team, first talked about the NBA in Zion I really don't have pressure/8c282cf23f904aba9e0ea15110f7ad8c.jpg" alt="Seven people scored double! Melly, representing the 28 Pelicans showdown team, first talked about the NBA in Zion I really don&#39;t have pressure"><br>James gained weight during the heat but suffered minor injuries, while Zion’s weight did not seem to have much impact on him at the moment.<br>According to a famous comment on Zion on the internet: “There will be no pressure in my life. My opponent weighs less than me, jumps less than me, and has less money than me. What pressure can I have?”  </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Last season, 76 players undoubtedly became the most unfortunate team in the league. They were just short of beating the Raptors. Leonard’s seventh winner shattered 76 people’s dreams. Otherwise, 76 people might have rushed out of the East to win the championship.<br>Because last season’s 76-man lineup was totally unafraid of the impact of the Bucks alphabet, and there was Butler at that time. But 76 people were horrible, even though they lost Butler this summer.<br>But 76 people got Richard Sen from the Heat, which could at least fill Butler’s flanking line after he left.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Simmons showcased the 28 teams just after winning a five-year contract of 170 million. Harris was not hiding/2ebf572111c249beb99f1c56cc0158ec.jpg" alt="Simmons showcased the 28 teams just after winning a five-year contract of 170 million. Harris was not hiding"><br>Another 76 have signed Hofford and renewed Simmons and Harris. In that case, the 76-man lineup is extremely strong, five-star for Harris + Simmons + Embed + Hofford + Richardson.<br>In the previous pre-season win over the Hornets, 76 people showed everyone their horrible offensive proficiency in the absence of Ambid. After Walker left the Hornets, Rozil was the substitute. But Rozil’s strength is far from Walker’s.<br>Master Jordan’s signing is likely to be in trouble again. Rozil can’t carry the wasp’s banner.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Simmons showcased the 28 teams just after winning a five-year contract of 170 million. Harris was not hiding/6ec6c6d49e954a468af9bcc47ac9a854.jpg" alt="Simmons showcased the 28 teams just after winning a five-year contract of 170 million. Harris was not hiding"><br>Another 76 players are currently the tallest team in the Eastern Conference, and the combination of Enbede and Hofford has basically restrained the Bucks in the style of play. It’s the Bucks that can compete with 76 players in the Eastern region. Now the style of play is restrained by 76 players. It seems that 76 players have great hope of breaking out of the Eastern region next season.<br>Simmons, the top player in the summer, has also been practicing his three-point long-range shooting ability, although it has not been a great threat. But Simonsken’s hard work in shooting is a good way to raise the 76-man team cap.<br>What are the goals of the 76 players for next season? Simmons also revealed his plans today to upgrade defense to the top of the league and win the championship.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Simmons showcased the 28 teams just after winning a five-year contract of 170 million.

Harris was not hiding"><br>Simmons said: “The most important thing for our team is the championship, and the most important thing for us in the new season is defense. We want to be the best defensive team in the NBA league.<br>We don’t know if 76 people can win the championship. Maybe there’s a chance. But I want to take defense to the top of the league. It seems harder than winning the championship. Simmons really doesn’t take the other 28 teams into consideration. I’m afraid Enbede dares not say that he can improve his defense to the first place in the league.<br>As for why the 28 teams? Because one team has been removed, but the others are innocent.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Simmons showcased the 28 teams just after winning a five-year contract of 170 million.

Harris was not hiding"><br>Last season, 76 players ranked 15th in defensive efficiency and 19th in loss per game. If 76 players want to improve their defense to the first place in the league, it will not only require Simmons to invest more in defense, but also Harris from the front line to strengthen defense.<br>Harris, as we all know, was not known for his defense in the past. He was called Zhongpai Anthony. On the offensive side, Harris is similar to Melon, but on the defensive side, he moves slowly.<br>Harris may be a little faster than Melon, but he’s never both offensive and defensive. He’s got three points, but he’s very defensive.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Simmons showcased the 28 teams just after winning a five-year contract of 170 million.

Harris was not hiding"><br>Only when Harris was interviewed today, he did not agree with the general view of the outside world on his defense. Harris was not hiding. He told reporters that he had practiced defense hard this summer and he wanted to be one of the best defenders.<br>Harris said, “I know the criticism from the outside world. I moved slowly and had a bad defense at the bottom. These are the issues I’ve been thinking about this summer. What I can tell you now is that I did spend a lot of time defending this summer. Because I want to be a very good player at both ends of the offense and defense, let defense be the focus of my game, I want to win the championship, but also want to be one of the best defenders in the league!<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Simmons showcased the 28 teams just after winning a five-year contract of 170 million.

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Since it’s a back-to-back game, Poseidon chose to take a rest and dongqiqi would surely bear more attack pressure, which is also a test of dongqiqi’s ability to lead the team alone. Grizzlies are not a strong team, and the main players are absent. Although the lone ranger lacks a strong attacking point, it is not difficult in theory to take a victory away from home.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/07/Single section 0 + 0 + 0! 28 minutes, 24 + 14 + 8 + 2, he lost before the Grizzlies had a full strength/398969da19f748dea464cee46a54a03b.jpg" alt="Single section 0 + 0 + 0! 28 minutes, 24 + 14 + 8 + 2, he lost before the Grizzlies had a full strength"><br>In the first quarter of the game, Boban played the center of lone ranger, and their attack ability on the inside dropped a lot, so dongqiqi tried his best to create attack opportunities for his teammates on the outside through his toss after the pick and roll. In the beginning of the game, Kuri got a very good cell phone conference, and made three three three-point shots in a row, but grizzly bear’s attack efficiency was also very high, The outside line is very accurate, the inside line is also very easy to play Boban, the difference has not been opened.<br>After Powell came up, he just increased the vitality of the inner line, not the efficiency of attack. After Powell received the pass, he could hardly handle the ball and wasted some good opportunities. In the second half of the game, both sides started to play iron mode, although the intensity of defense on the field is not big, but the player’s hit rate is very low. At the end of the first quarter, the two sides finished 31-34, grizzlies led by 3 points, and Dongqi got 10 + 7 + 5 in a single quarter.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/07/Single section 0 + 0 + 0! 28 minutes, 24 + 14 + 8 + 2, he lost before the Grizzlies had a full strength/3a860682f2c3440d9404763e9e34fc5e.jpg" alt="Single section 0 + 0 + 0! 28 minutes, 24 + 14 + 8 + 2, he lost before the Grizzlies had a full strength"><br>The second quarter of the game, the two sides came on the bench, also did not produce a better defensive performance, but the gap is out. Grizzlies don’t have a good attack and organization. Under the leadership of Bronson, the lone ranger is very smooth in attack and has a high hit rate. In less than three minutes, he has a wave of 13-6, exceeding the difference. The lone ranger didn’t change their attack and defense after he asked for a pause. The lone ranger substitute then played a wave. The inner line’s passing and cutting cooperation, the outer line’s chasing 3 + 1, and the instantaneous difference was 13 points. The game was less than half played, the two sides played 24-8, Dongqi has not yet played.<br>After the main players of both sides came back, dongqiqi played health basketball with the advantage of 10 points. Most of the rounds were organized and attacked by Kuri, and dongqiqi stood by watching. In the last minute of the game, dongqiqi wanted to hold the ball and play two, but he was defended by Claude and other Grizzlies. The lone ranger’s attack was confused, and Grizzlies hit three counterattacks in a row, and all of them were successful. At the end of the second quarter, Grizzlies and lone Rangers finished 62-68. In addition to playing time and making a mistake, there was no increase in any other data.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/07/Single section 0 + 0 + 0! 28 minutes, 24 + 14 + 8 + 2, he lost before the Grizzlies had a full strength/830dde9e70d54115b789c2d55a4c32ca.jpg" alt="Single section 0 + 0 + 0! 28 minutes, 24 + 14 + 8 + 2, he lost before the Grizzlies had a full strength"><br>In the third quarter of the game, dongqiqi strengthened his personal attack at the beginning. In the second quarter of the game, the rest time was too long. In more than two minutes, three of the four attack rounds were personal attack with the ball. Two goals were continuously thrown out of the three-point line. One player scored 8 points in a row and stopped playing Grizzlies. But after the pause, grizzlies scored three goals in a row, changed a 7-0 wave, and reduced the difference to 4 points again. The attack of lone ranger is very organized, but the three points of defense end, dongqiqi, Curie and Boban, are almost the level of loopholes.<br>After changing back to Powell, the overall mobility of lone ranger increased. Dongqiqi connected the team’s attack in the second half of the game. However, his teammates played iron many times, and Kuri wasted many empty shot opportunities. Grizzlies also play very simple, almost in two conduction ball on the shot. At the end of the third quarter, the two sides played 104-91, with lone ranger leading by 13 points, while dongqiqi got 24 points, 14 rebounds and 8 assists, quasi triple double.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/07/Single section 0 + 0 + 0! 28 minutes, 24 + 14 + 8 + 2, he lost before the Grizzlies had a full strength/cb02b884d20842b99fa5026d03aed682.jpg" alt="Single section 0 + 0 + 0! 28 minutes, 24 + 14 + 8 + 2, he lost before the Grizzlies had a full strength"><br>At the end of the game, the two sides started a fight against each other. The attack was very simple, because there was no defense on both sides, but the difference was always over 10 points, which was not friendly to Grizzlies. In the last five minutes of the game, under the leadership of Bronson, the lone ranger expanded the difference to 20 points. Dongqiqi was a back-to-back game. Although he missed two assists to play three pairs, there was no need to come back and brush the data.<br>In the whole game, the two sides played 138-122. Dongqiqi played 28 minutes, made 9 of 16 shots, 2 of 6 3-pointers, got 24 points, 14 rebounds, 8 assists, 2 steals, 2 mistakes, plus or minus 1. Among them, dongqiqi only played half a quarter in the second quarter of the game, angrily cutting 0 + 0 + 0, doubting that he was learning from James in rowing, but there is no evidence, if not rowing, it is estimated that he can cut three pairs in three quarters.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/07/Single section 0 + 0 + 0! 28 minutes, 24 + 14 + 8 + 2, he lost before the Grizzlies had a full strength/93ea75c597174be88140b8d7431eca21.jpg" alt="Single section 0 + 0 + 0! 28 minutes, 24 + 14 + 8 + 2, he lost before the Grizzlies had a full strength"><br>On the whole, it’s easy for lone ranger to win this game. Grizzlies are not a strong team. They thought the defense would be better, but from the performance point of view, the defense is positive and bad. Lone ranger’s advantage is built in the rotation time, and the second team easily builds the leading advantage. The Grizzlies have a lot of absentees. Jarun Jackson has a good performance, scoring 23 points. The rest of the players are mediocre.</p>

<h1 id="Curie’s-Ballless-Running"><a href="#Curie’s-Ballless-Running" class="headerlink" title="Curie’s Ballless Running"></a>Curie’s Ballless Running</h1><p>Let’s take the Western Final just finished, the Warriors against Trail Blazers at the end of the G4 first quarter, Stephen Curry’s classic free-kick run as an example.<br>In the previous defensive rounds, the Warriors successfully defended the Blazers’attack, and Luni got the front rebound, Luni got the front rebound, 24 seconds has begun to count. Luni then handed the ball to Livingston, who then handed it to Curie to push it forward.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/01/Stephen Coory's ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors'basketball team/3233ecce798d40baa32b40ec539cf0db.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry&#39;s ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors&#39;basketball team"><br>​<br>Curie then pushed forward, facing his younger brother Seth-Curie on the right. A simple change did not get rid of Seth, who was familiar with his habits. He turned and protruded from the left into the interior. He saw the empty Livingston and wanted to send a concealed pass to Livingston to attack the basket directly.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/01/Stephen Coory's ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors'basketball team/cbccfb9c35fa4155b44fda45e526312f.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry&#39;s ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors&#39;basketball team"><br>​<br>But this intention was spotted by Hood in front of Curie, who intercepted the downward pass in the air.<br>But Kuri, who is quick with eye problems and hands, will soon get the uncontrolled ball back into his hand and run to the bottom left corner. At this time, Hood and Kouri directly formed a replacement. Curie had the ability to shoot three quick shots at the bottom left corner, and Hood dared not jump out.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/01/Stephen Coory's ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors'basketball team/ce46934195e04ec9af1cfca24016c347.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry&#39;s ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors&#39;basketball team"><br>​<br>This opportunity was fleeting, and Curie did not force it. He did not choose to project but continued to break through when the Hood Center was too far ahead.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/01/Stephen Coory's ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors'basketball team/de2bc108e61c4689bad551ef17bcb12b.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry&#39;s ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors&#39;basketball team"><br>​<br>During the run, Curie handed the ball directly to Luni, who was unattended at the top of the arc. This is certainly not an opportunity for Luni to shoot three points, but a Give and go. Curie tries to get a three-point shot by running with the help of teammates.<br>In the course of running to the right side of the court, the rookie Jacob Evans’s analysis of Curie’s tactical intentions is obviously not enough. He didn’t help Curie to block the following Curie for the first time, so Luni didn’t choose to pass the ball.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/01/Stephen Coory's ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors'basketball team/11d5a83a111f458499c4a40fa94125f1.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry&#39;s ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors&#39;basketball team"><br>​<br>But then Kouri and Lillard completed the defense change again, and Luni taught Green the ball.<br>If Lillard does not concentrate on his back, a rhythm shift in Curie may be able to throw Lillard away and then follow up with a dream pass to shoot three points at the bottom corner, but even if Lillard turns his back on Green, he still concentrates all his attention on Curie.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/01/Stephen Coory's ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors'basketball team/ae51db5265df462d8ba20e9101e3aabd.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry&#39;s ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors&#39;basketball team"><br>​<br>So instead of trapping himself in the bottom corner, he dribbled the ball to the top of the arc.<br>From the beginning of dribbing the ball to the top of the arc, Curie realized that it would also be a three-point tactic designed for him. Although Dream-chasing handed the ball to Jacob Evans for a transition, it was still for a better catch at the top of the arc.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/01/Stephen Coory's ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors'basketball team/e80181b61dfa43dcbb815b80d17704ce.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry&#39;s ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors&#39;basketball team"><br>​<br>And Curie has begun to act. Left Livingston and Luni were supposed to set up double gear at 45 degrees on the left, but Lillard slowed down for a moment, and Curie reached the top three points of the left arc with Livingston’s single gear.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/01/Stephen Coory's ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors'basketball team/ed80d68ac7b649fc8d0db4753362ec23.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry&#39;s ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors&#39;basketball team"><br>​<br>Green passed directly across.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/01/Stephen Coory's ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors'basketball team/0c73a0b158d44dc195f228e5d6ac587f.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry&#39;s ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors&#39;basketball team"><br>​<br>Lillard, who slowed down a step, wanted to interfere, but couldn’t keep up with it. He could only jump up the cover. After Kuri shakes Lillard off with a false move, he was confident to shoot in less than three seconds and hit three points!<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/01/Stephen Coory's ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors'basketball team/51c541acc61845a7b05929226dd8df0c.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry&#39;s ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors&#39;basketball team"><br>​<br>So far, from the Warriors to rebound to advance to the front, Kuri’s defender changed four times, Kuri ran two laps around the three-point line, and finally the Warriors patiently spent almost 24 seconds of offensive time to find the best opportunity, found the game feel quite good in the Kuri. Curie eventually hit three points with his knife in his hand.<br>In fact, the Warriors’line-up, other players have limited ability to attack independently, but they still rely on Kuri’s ball-free and opponents play back and forth. The Warriors’other players, regardless of their positions or passing choices, handled them calmly and wisely.<br>As the core player of the Warriors, Curie is willing to surrender the right of the guard to his teammates, to run without the ball, or even to block and tear the ball to his teammates. This may be the place where the Warriors basketball team is really stronger than other teams.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/01/Stephen Coory's ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors'basketball team/4b2b01e1ce764ea8884299974ab5bd18.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry&#39;s ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors&#39;basketball team"><br>​</p>

Especially in this series, they wrapped him up and he gave me the ball and trusted my organization. Whether it’s scoring or assisting teammates, he always trusts me, which we have since 2015. If he wants to shoot, no one blames him, but he passes the ball to me and gives me confidence.<br>This is the words after the G4 chasing dream, chasing dream oneself is very clear, his assistant data soaring and Kuri’s assistant data all the way down is the corresponding.<br>During the 13-14 season, Curie averaged 8.5 assists per game, which ranked fifth in the league.<br>Since then, the 14-15 season in which the Warriors really began to rise, Curie’s assists have continued to decline, from 7.7 in 14-15 season to 5.2 in 2018-19 season.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/01/Stephen Coory's ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors'basketball team/e03b9c4a564e4c339a6ae301a27146d8.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry&#39;s ball-free attack is the foundation of the Golden State Warriors&#39;basketball team"><br>​<br>However, the number of dream-pursuing assists has increased from 3.7 assists in the 14-15 season to 7 in the last four years.<br>It was his amazing performance in the 2014-15 season that earned him the first big contract in his career.

    <title>Summary of the game James three pairs of difficult rescuers, the Lakers exposed three major problems in the first game</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Lakers used to rank first in the West with a series of seven wins. Although they lost to the Raptors this time, they were still the first in the West. But this game really woke up the Lakers.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/05/Summary of the game James three pairs of difficult rescuers, the Lakers exposed three major problems in the first game/38ea4c966e264cadadf6d7a89dc28408.jpg" alt="Summary of the game James three pairs of difficult rescuers, the Lakers exposed three major problems in the first game"><br>In that seven game winning streak, the Lakers played against the wind in several games, especially in lone Rangers and bulls. At the beginning of the game, the offense was not good. James started to play from the end of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Howard came up to play on the inside line for 12 minutes, supporting the defense framework of the Lakers. Those young players certainly couldn’t stand the Lakers’ play at the critical moment. So the Lakers have won 7 consecutive games before, but problems have arisen, just because they won the game, they have not been taken seriously and seriously.<br>The Lakers started the game well against raptors. Although the defense was not as strong as the heat in the last game, they did a good job in defending the two attack strengths of raptors. Unlike the previous games, the Lakers took the lead in the first half, fell behind in the second half, and reversed the situation in the last game. However, the other team is no longer a reconstruction team, but a championship team. What’s more, it’s not as easy to reverse the game as the defense they relied on before?<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/05/Summary of the game James three pairs of difficult rescuers, the Lakers exposed three major problems in the first game/12ee7fd47b004b8a9c4b9aee036802e1.jpg" alt="Summary of the game James three pairs of difficult rescuers, the Lakers exposed three major problems in the first game"><br>What problems did the Lakers expose in the game against the Raptors that led them to lose? Next, I’ll smooth three points.</p>
<h1 id="first-there-is-only-one-player-in-the-team-with-rhythm-James-is-too-late"><a href="#first-there-is-only-one-player-in-the-team-with-rhythm-James-is-too-late" class="headerlink" title="first, there is only one player in the team with rhythm, James is too late"></a>first, there is only one player in the team with rhythm, James is too late</h1><p>From the game point of view, the Lakers’ point guard is only James. Although cook and Caruso are nominally capable of playing and organizing attacks, in fact, their performance on the court is basically unable to bear the responsibility of holding the ball and organizing attacks. Cook himself is not good at organizing attacks. He is a scorer and is good at using cover to make jump shots and three-point fixed-point shots. Caruso has the ability to organize the game, but there is no feature of being standard, and he is careless. There are many mistakes, which is totally inconsistent with the off-season expectations. So when the Lakers have a smooth attack, it’s when James is on the court. James is the only one in the team who has a rhythmic ability. Once he leaves the court, the Lakers start to have problems.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/05/Summary of the game James three pairs of difficult rescuers, the Lakers exposed three major problems in the first game/5eaa71f3e07045aeabd8246031158ce5.jpg" alt="Summary of the game James three pairs of difficult rescuers, the Lakers exposed three major problems in the first game"><br>In the first quarter, James played half of the game. When he went down to rest, the Lakers led by 9 points, and James’s positive and negative value was + 9. During this period, James sent assistant to Bradley, assistant to McGee, and directed teammates to run on the outside line. He created a chance to hold the ball in high position and low position for thick eyebrows. The attack of the Lakers was not disordered as a whole. But after the next game, the Lakers didn’t have a point guard. Most of the attacks were mainly focused on the thick eyebrow. Players like pop and Daniels have been to cross the ball, and they stiffly thrust the ball into the thick eyebrow’s hands. The attack stopped in an instant.<br>The Raptors saw the weakness of the Lakers. Once the thick eyebrows received the ball, they sent two people to bag him before he let it go, and they came from the bottom line on the back side of him, completely blocking the vision of the thick eyebrows passing, causing him a lot of pressure, forcing the Lakers’ pitchers to deal with the ball and dominate the ball, which is a defensive success in itself. Except for James and Rondo, the Lakers no longer have a second organizer who can control the ball, so the Lakers need Rondo urgently, otherwise the thick eyebrows will play very hard on the court.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/05/Summary of the game James three pairs of difficult rescuers, the Lakers exposed three major problems in the first game/792787afd4374da5a44cb8f6bfa904ce.jpg" alt="Summary of the game James three pairs of difficult rescuers, the Lakers exposed three major problems in the first game"></p>
<h1 id="second-three-defensive-loopholes-reveal-the-essence-of-raptors’-targeted-attack"><a href="#second-three-defensive-loopholes-reveal-the-essence-of-raptors’-targeted-attack" class="headerlink" title="second, three defensive loopholes reveal the essence of raptors’ targeted attack"></a>second, three defensive loopholes reveal the essence of raptors’ targeted attack</h1><p>In the past nine games, the Lakers have three major defensive holes, Kuzma, McGee and pop. McGrady’s defense in the inner line is almost nothing but blocking. Once the opponent eats McGrady with his feet, he has no way. The defense will be nothing. McGrady gets three fouls in the first half of the game. Pop’s positioning is a 3D player, but the gap between the defensive end and the other two 3D players, green and Bradley, is very large, just the defensive end. Pop’s defense is not much worse, not to be missed, but it’s standard, not aggressive, not characteristic, not good, not bad, in essence, not high enthusiasm.<br>The problem of Kuzma is very big. Kuzma is a player with strong offensive ability but poor defensive efficiency. Vogel gave him a lot of time to adapt to the team and rhythm of the game, and even sacrificed the playing time of Howard and McGee to Kuzma, let him partner with bushmei, let him play the five small teams at the critical moment. From Kuzma’s performance in this game, it is not satisfactory. He scored 15 points in 6-for-13 shots, including two 3-pointers, but the defensive side was too problematic. Once he came on the court, he would be hit by the opponent’s attack core singles, and the success rate was very high. The Lakers themselves are a defensive team. They use defense to drive the attack and suppress the opponent. Once there is no defense, they will collapse at both ends of the attack and defense. Kuzma just got on sikam. In the rotation time, the original attack efficiency of the Lakers will decline. If there is no defense, they can’t score, then the morale of the whole team will collapse.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/05/Summary of the game James three pairs of difficult rescuers, the Lakers exposed three major problems in the first game/c06e8cc41bd34212a805b2598ade2edb.jpg" alt="Summary of the game James three pairs of difficult rescuers, the Lakers exposed three major problems in the first game"></p>

Danny greenbradley, pop, Kuzma, Daniels, cook, even James and bushbrow are all players who can cast outside. But judging from the performance on the field, green has been in a low state in several games. In this game, he missed many opportunities with three-point ball and four shots. Pop was directly abandoned by Vogel. Out of the three-point line of bushbrow and James, he made seven shots and two shots. Only Daniels made several three-point balls. During that time, the Lakers stopped raptors and two key three-point points of Kuzma were saved The hope of winning, but in addition, the Lakers’ three-point ball has never been smooth, even if there is an opportunity outside, there is no way to grasp.<br>James, as the leader of the team, should take an important responsibility. Although he has three pairs, he has only 13 points in 15 shots, which is a very inefficient game for James, a top five player in the league. There is no other organizer to help James share the pressure of holding the ball, so James will play very tired, which may be the reason why he doesn’t want to start the attack mode too early, but James started the game in the last five minutes, it’s a bit late, his physical strength is limited, the ability to end the basketball is declining, and he can’t bring the Lakers out of the abyss. The Raptors were able to complete the 2-4 reversal even though they were 0-2 behind. They were not afraid of the coming of the critical moment. James applied the tactics used by the bulls and the lone rangers to the Raptors, which was obviously not applicable.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/05/Summary of the game James three pairs of difficult rescuers, the Lakers exposed three major problems in the first game/6d1f1ac72b884d30978cb408a308a400.jpg" alt="Summary of the game James three pairs of difficult rescuers, the Lakers exposed three major problems in the first game"><br>Of course, the Lakers have an excuse to comfort themselves, that is, Rondo has not recovered from injury. We don’t know what kind of changes will be brought by his return. Now we have to wait for Rondo to come back and see if we can help the Lakers increase the depth of the lineup.</p>

    <title>Super guard commented on Lin Shuhao&#39;s comments He made enough money and should learn to appreciate it</title>
    <url>/2019/07/20/Super%20guard%20commented%20on%20Lin%20Shuhao&#39;s%20comments%20He%20made%20enough%20money%20and%20should%20learn%20to%20appreciate%20it/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Lin Shuhao, probably the strongest active basketball player in the world, failed to get an NBA contract extension in the free market despite winning the first NBA championship with the Raptors last season.<br>In his speech in Taiwan a few days ago, Lin Shuhao expressed his emotion that life is really difficult. The free market has become the last straw to crush him. The NBA seems not to want itself. For a time, his encounters and comments aroused widespread sympathy among players and fans. Even Wilkins, the famous Hawks player, said that it was difficult for Lin Shuhao to contact him at any time.<br>But there are also different voices. The Blazers super guard CJ-McCollem disagrees with him. McCollem believes that Lin Shuhao earned 65 million dollars in the league, which is a sufficient number. He should learn to be grateful more than those who have never been in the NBA.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/20/Super guard commented on Lin Shuhao's comments He made enough money and should learn to appreciate it/cda5733ca23846518ebfd3632cf4ec70.jpg" alt="Super guard commented on Lin Shuhao&#39;s comments He made enough money and should learn to appreciate it"><br>​<br>Lin Shuhao lost the draft in 2010 and has been in the NBA League for nine years. In nine years, Lin Shuhao’s total salary has reached 65.71 million US dollars, which is an unexpected figure for many people. When he first joined the league, Lin Shuhao tossed around and signed a two-year contract with the Warriors, a contract with partial guarantee for the 2010-11 season, team options for the second year and an annual salary of $470,000.<br>The following year, Lin Shuhao was laid off by the Warriors, followed by the Rockets, and the New York Knicks signed him with a partial guarantee contract of $760,000. Lin Shuhao seized the opportunity in New York and set off a storm of “forest madness” sweeping the world. But soon after, he was greeted with ligament tear, so that he was reimbursed for the season, which was the hottest period of his life.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/20/Super guard commented on Lin Shuhao's comments He made enough money and should learn to appreciate it/dba76af4bb0144be811ee843e101bfba.jpg" alt="Super guard commented on Lin Shuhao&#39;s comments He made enough money and should learn to appreciate it"><br>​<br>After all, Lin Shuhao made his mark. During the off-season of 2012, the Rockets first offered Lin Shuhao a four-year contract worth $28.8 million, but the Knicks will match the contract.<br>In order to get Lin Shuhao, the Rockets changed the details of the contract and provided a new contract of $25 million for three years, 5 million for the first two years and 5.22 million for the third year, and up to $14.8 million for the third year. Many people in the industry call the contract “poison contract”. Lin Shuhao also began his rocket career.<br>In the next three years, Lin Shuhao’s performance did not match the contract. The Rockets chose to trade him to the Lakers in the third year. Lin Shuhao in the Lakers’time averaged 11.4 points and 4.6 assists in 25.8 minutes, which was also a passing answer.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/20/Super guard commented on Lin Shuhao's comments He made enough money and should learn to appreciate it/5786a28d143e41469fffb284d1751516.jpg" alt="Super guard commented on Lin Shuhao&#39;s comments He made enough money and should learn to appreciate it"><br>​<br>In the off-season of 2015, Lin Shuhao chose a base salary of 2.1 million to join the Charlotte Hornets in order to prove himself again. In the Hornets, Lin Shuhao played well and helped him win what may be the last big contract in his career.<br>In the 2016 season, Lin Shuhao and the Brooklyn Nets reached a three-year contract of $36 million. In the first season of the Nets, he could get 14.5 points, 5.1 assists, 3.8 rebounds and 1.2 steals in 24 minutes, which was a good start for Lin Shuhao to start a new course, but injuries destroyed him again. Just after the start of the 2017 regular season, he suffered a ligament rupture that led to his reimbursement for the whole season. Then Lin Shuhao was traded to the Eagles.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/20/Super guard commented on Lin Shuhao's comments He made enough money and should learn to appreciate it/07e2847bea8e43aaa2054900a1f76c78.jpg" alt="Super guard commented on Lin Shuhao&#39;s comments He made enough money and should learn to appreciate it"><br>​<br>Eagle is not fighting for the championship, just want to train the new star Trey Young, eager to win Lin Shuhao can only choose to buy out to join the Eastern Raptors. But in the last dozen games of the Raptors, Lin Shuhao did not seize the opportunity, and the playoffs became almost the last member of the bench. He did not get the chance to play in regular time, which led to the dilemma that the free market is still unknown for more than a month now.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/20/Super guard commented on Lin Shuhao's comments He made enough money and should learn to appreciate it/898d236d57594ed495967b229314e900.jpg" alt="Super guard commented on Lin Shuhao&#39;s comments He made enough money and should learn to appreciate it"><br>​<br>As a yellow race, it is not easy to get to the present situation in the NBA. In the final analysis, the NBA is a business league, and it is impossible to impress the general managers of each team without good performance. But Lin Shuhao still has strength and can be the organizing point of the team’s second line-up. Just give him a chance. I believe that Lin Shuhao will prove himself again.</p>

    <title>Take Spain lightly in the warm-up! Do you think the U.S. team won the World Cup unsteadily Don&#39;t kid me</title>
    <url>/2019/07/26/Take%20Spain%20lightly%20in%20the%20warm-up!%20Do%20you%20think%20the%20U.S.%20team%20won%20the%20World%20Cup%20unsteadily%20Don&#39;t%20kid%20me/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/26/Take Spain lightly in the warm-up! Do you think the U.S. team won the World Cup unsteadily Don't kid me/ff149aaf972441d486faecc644814b00.jpg" alt="Take Spain lightly in the warm-up! Do you think the U.S. team won the World Cup unsteadily Don&#39;t kid me"><br>​<br>When many of the past stars of the U.S. team withdrew one after another, when the U.S. team lost the match to the accompanying team, when the star light of the U.S. team seems to have reached the lowest point in history, people think that the U.S. is really as unstable as Kobe said.<br>But the fact is, whether in terms of odds or strength, the U.S. team still occupies the absolute top of the World Cup.<br>As an Australian player said before, even if the United States withdraws many players, such a team is still better than any existing NBA-level team. After all, all the players of this team are NBA starters, and the NBA-level team, even the five-star starters like the Warriors last season. Their substitutes are also at the bottom of the league.<br>Such a team, even going to the NBA, has the strength to compete for the NBA championship, so when it comes to the World Cup, it will lose its dominance? This is unreasonable.<br>Today, the warm-up match between the United States and Spain is a very telling story.<br>In this game, the United States eventually took Spain 90-81 lightly, Spain also relied on the last minute to grab three points before the score reached double digits.<br>On the American side, Mitchell scored the highest 13 points, Walker scored 11 points, 6 rebounds and 8 assists, Tatum scored 11 points, 5 rebounds and 4 rebounds and 2 rebounds, Spain’s Rubio scored 16 points, 3 rebounds and 7 rebounds and Pau Gasol scored 19 points, 3 rebounds and 2 caps.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/26/Take Spain lightly in the warm-up! Do you think the U.S. team won the World Cup unsteadily Don't kid me/0286a897f4d2409187b19a79ea0a1e9f.jpg" alt="Take Spain lightly in the warm-up! Do you think the U.S. team won the World Cup unsteadily Don&#39;t kid me"><br>​<br>Spain is also an old strong team in international competitions. As the former world champion team, their team is still quite strong in strength although it is aging. Such a team, with Rubio, Pau Gasol, Hernan Gomez and other NBA players in Spain, and the United States team warming-up game, it can be predicted that the quality of the game will not be low.<br>From the opening point of view, the two sides did have some tit-for-tat meanings. Spain’s half-court offense was led by Rubio and Gasol, who cooperated well with each other. Rubio’s mid-range projection, and the tandem scoring were more comfortable in the national team system, while Gasol’s offensive countermeasure and the defensive side’s sitting in the middle of the field, let him play. Spain’s Offensive-Defensive balance.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/26/Take Spain lightly in the warm-up! Do you think the U.S. team won the World Cup unsteadily Don't kid me/3ab1dbedd5044aa9a64abc6001bfbe35.jpg" alt="Take Spain lightly in the warm-up! Do you think the U.S. team won the World Cup unsteadily Don&#39;t kid me"><br>​<br>Wal and Mitchell are the first and second players sent by the United States team. Of course, from the point of view of the rotation of the whole game, the match between the two players has not played a very good effect. The existence of Pau Gasol has limited their breakthroughs.<br>On the guard line, the United States team also has Derek White, Joe Harris and White’s role at both ends of the offense and defense is remarkable, but Joe Harris’s projection is very limited by Spain’s rapid co-defense.<br>However, the United States team’s front-line combination showed a better performance, Barnes did not have many opportunities to play this game, the main opportunities are in the hands of Tatum, Jay Brown, Middleton and Kuzma.<br>The four front lines, Tatum and Jay Brown have better impact, and the end near the basket is more stable. Middleton’s three-point and mid-distance make him more adaptable to the rules of FIBA. Kuzma’s fast down, three-point rush and bottom-slip also play a good role. The combination of front lines is the United States team’s own game instead. A more splendid place.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/26/Take Spain lightly in the warm-up! Do you think the U.S. team won the World Cup unsteadily Don't kid me/00966465f7184d2da91c25f3e93053d9.jpg" alt="Take Spain lightly in the warm-up! Do you think the U.S. team won the World Cup unsteadily Don&#39;t kid me"><br>​<br>The interior might have been the most worrying position for the U.S. team, but in fact, the three interiors that the U.S. team brought, Lopez had guards and three points, Turner’s front rebounds and blocked shots, and Pramley’s spare parts, were enough to deal with most of the international situation.<br>It is worth mentioning that the three-point ability of the U.S. team is probably the most easily overlooked but also the most powerful place. Their players basically have the ability to shoot from the outside. In this game, the three-point help the U.S. team to take the lead in opening up the situation.<br>Of course, at the end of the game, Spain once worked hard to get the score close, neither side really entered the state of tearing, the United States team in the first half, Spain in the second half significantly strengthened the defense, both sides are satisfied with the results of this game.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/26/Take Spain lightly in the warm-up! Do you think the U.S. team won the World Cup unsteadily Don't kid me/5c3de4125482446c9873d0910fdf84bf.jpg" alt="Take Spain lightly in the warm-up! Do you think the U.S. team won the World Cup unsteadily Don&#39;t kid me"><br>​<br>Don’t forget, even if many stars retire, the difficulty of winning the World Cup is only from easy to general.</p>

For example, Kury suffered serious injuries in the first three years of his career. His first entry into the playoffs was in the 2012-13 season. Of course, Kury’s first entry into the playoffs has shown the explosive power of scoring that shocked the basketball world. He scored in the first round and scored in the following rounds. Kim, in the second round against the old Spurs, the Warriors’youth storm is actually worse than that experience.<br>In the following season of 2013-14, they lost to the Clippers in the first round without major generals. From the beginning of the season of 2014-15, the Warriors really rose completely.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/19/The NBA Supergiants have never been out of the first round of the two gods, Jordan Kobe O'Neill did not do it/93beaba6bafb4900b12c1e6773a8b137.jpg" alt="The NBA Supergiants have never been out of the first round of the two gods, Jordan Kobe O&#39;Neill did not do it"><br>​<br>Although Alphabet Brother’s entire career is still growing, but before the Bucks’strength is relatively general, the record is only the midstream level. From the beginning of the 2014-15 season, Alphabet Brother has stopped the first round of the playoffs for three consecutive years, only this year’s MVP season rushed to the Eastern Finals regrettably defeated.<br>Harden is actually both lucky and powerful. He has never missed the playoffs in his career, but he has been out in the first round in his rookie days at Thunder and in three years of Rockets’seven-year career.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/19/The NBA Supergiants have never been out of the first round of the two gods, Jordan Kobe O'Neill did not do it/d199d0b2b8214d8eb82e7785904ebd5f.jpg" alt="The NBA Supergiants have never been out of the first round of the two gods, Jordan Kobe O&#39;Neill did not do it"><br>​<br>Leonard’s previous playoff career has been following the Spurs, but even if the Spurs have not been able to play regularly in the past 20 years, there are also moments when the Spurs lost their front foot. In the 2014-15 season, the Spurs lost the Clippers in the first seven games, which is the only first time that Leonard was out.<br>Durant entered the playoffs with his young Thunder in the 2009-2010 season. Although Durant averaged 25 points per game, his first entry into the playoffs was obviously not well adapted to the rhythm of the game. His shooting percentage was only 35%, and they were eventually defeated by the Lakers in the first round.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/19/The NBA Supergiants have never been out of the first round of the two gods, Jordan Kobe O'Neill did not do it/8f358d57b39b4292a9354a0eca1a1181.jpg" alt="The NBA Supergiants have never been out of the first round of the two gods, Jordan Kobe O&#39;Neill did not do it"><br>​<br>Of the six superstars in active service, only LeBron James has never experienced a first-round exit in his career. In fact, only LeBron James and “Lord of the Rings” Russell have never tasted the first-round exit.<br>LeBron James has been in the playoffs 13 times since the third season of his career. He has never been out of the first round. The worst result is in the semi-finals.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/19/The NBA Supergiants have never been out of the first round of the two gods, Jordan Kobe O'Neill did not do it/3371e199777b459e9faae7d38aea43f1.jpg" alt="The NBA Supergiants have never been out of the first round of the two gods, Jordan Kobe O&#39;Neill did not do it"><br>​<br>James averaged 30.8 points, 8.1 rebounds and 5.8 assists throughout the playoffs in the 2005-06 season. Although they made 5 mistakes per game, they won the Wizards 4-2 in the first round, and the Pistons in the second round and the stubborn Pistons in the next seven games. In the 2006-07 season, the Cavaliers were in that position. But under the leadership of James I, he crossed the Pistons and reached the Finals.<br>Russell, who had 11 championship rings and completed eight consecutive championships, had never been out of the first round in his career. Although there were fewer NBA teams in that era, it was not easy to maintain this competitiveness for as long as 10 years.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/19/The NBA Supergiants have never been out of the first round of the two gods, Jordan Kobe O'Neill did not do it/0f456c1fdb7d4f7e8af4f6dafed67d7b.jpg" alt="The NBA Supergiants have never been out of the first round of the two gods, Jordan Kobe O&#39;Neill did not do it"><br>​<br>Apart from these two great gods, there are countless superstars in NBA history, but even the most dazzling ones have failed to accomplish what they never did in the first round.<br>Jordan scored 63 points, the highest in NBA playoff history, against defending champion Celtics in the early stages of his career playoffs, but he could not escape the first round exit.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/19/The NBA Supergiants have never been out of the first round of the two gods, Jordan Kobe O'Neill did not do it/0f9179bfed8345f19694f93fbe5dbf32.jpg" alt="The NBA Supergiants have never been out of the first round of the two gods, Jordan Kobe O&#39;Neill did not do it"><br>​<br>Kobe Bryant’s first-round exit is also many, the early Lakers career, and the period after the break-up with O’Neill, Kobe Bryant has experienced the first-round exit, 06-07 season that average 32.8 points Kobe, still can not really compete with a team.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/19/The NBA Supergiants have never been out of the first round of the two gods, Jordan Kobe O'Neill did not do it/c8162d394a9e4c9cb7b23ff1b75ace0d.jpg" alt="The NBA Supergiants have never been out of the first round of the two gods, Jordan Kobe O&#39;Neill did not do it"><br>​<br>There’s O’Neill, whose dominance at the top is naturally horrible, but he went through the first round of exits in his juvenile shark days and later in his career.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/19/The NBA Supergiants have never been out of the first round of the two gods, Jordan Kobe O'Neill did not do it/764da81a1de64b538d95d15723459623.jpg" alt="The NBA Supergiants have never been out of the first round of the two gods, Jordan Kobe O&#39;Neill did not do it"><br>​<br>Career has never been out of the first round, not only need to maintain the peak level, maybe sometimes also need some luck.</p>

At that time, the Golden State Warriors team in 2013 was already a team with Stephen Curie as its absolute core.<br>Seth, who lost the draft in 2013, signed a non-guaranteed contract before the Warriors, playing in the pre-season for the team, and growing up in the Warriors’Development League team, the Santa Cruz Warriors.<br>After that, Seth began a bumpy journey from Warriors to Grizzlies, then to Cavaliers, to Phoenix to sign a 10-day contract, and then the Sun did not choose to renew it.<br>Seth also played in the summer league for Pelicans in 2015. And then my brother Stephen Curie won another championship for the Warriors in the 40 years after the 74-75 season. The Golden State Warriors’Little Ball Storm swept the league.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/11/Seth-Curie's stubbornness and pursuit, and the horror projection genes of the Curie family/52de5770eda84a8b9d610d8a24621b3a.jpg" alt="Seth-Curie&#39;s stubbornness and pursuit, and the horror projection genes of the Curie family"><br>​</p>

Later in the season, Cess refused to execute the Kings’contract and became a free agent. He chose to sign for Dallas, where he played his best season in his career.<br>Average 29 minutes per game, 42 starts in 70 games, the three-point shooting rate is still 42.5% efficient, the highest career average of 12.8 points per game, in addition to 2.6 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.1 steals.<br>But in February, the season underwent surgery on the left leg and tibia, and the season was reimbursed, entering a long recovery period.<br>Injuries once again seem to cast a shadow on Cescu’s future, but his excellent performance has given him great confidence in bringing in his team. The name of the Kuri family is also trustworthy.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/11/Seth-Curie's stubbornness and pursuit, and the horror projection genes of the Curie family/31ad68c4bdaf44828883dc7e37874fca.jpg" alt="Seth-Curie&#39;s stubbornness and pursuit, and the horror projection genes of the Curie family"><br>​<br>Eventually, before the start of the 2018 season, the Blazers won Seth-Curie on a two-year contract, and Seth-Curie proved his health by playing a healthy season for the Blazers.<br>In these 74 matches, Cess basically played as the main substitute, averaging 18.9 minutes per game. The three-point shooting rate was still 45% efficient, averaging 6.3 total shots per game, 3.4 three-point shots and 7.9 points.<br>Seth Curie, who had a firm foothold among the pioneers of the Western Powerful Team, followed the stubborn Pioneers all the way to the front of his brother Stephen Curie.<br>“I want to live in the present. My previous goal was to get into the playoffs and experience the atmosphere of the playoffs. I had never played in the playoffs in my previous career. But now we have reached the Western Conference, although the opponents are warriors, we still look forward to challenging for the final seat. To tell you the truth, this year has been a bit fantastic for me. I am now in a Western Conference team and have a stable playing time. I really appreciate the excellent team like Blazers for giving me the chance. I have to cherish everything now and I will try my best to help the team move forward. That’s what Seth Cooley said in an interview.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/11/Seth-Curie's stubbornness and pursuit, and the horror projection genes of the Curie family/992c34ceac8b400b81388ad9bf97c2a5.jpg" alt="Seth-Curie&#39;s stubbornness and pursuit, and the horror projection genes of the Curie family"><br>​<br>Just four years ago, he was still wandering in the league, wandering around for a contract. At that time, Seth watched his two-year-old brother roaring in the league. While he was happy for his brother, he thought that he would be sad, unwilling and regretful.<br>His goal at that time was only to get an NBA contract and recognition, but now he has entered the playoffs, he has an indispensable contribution in the team, he faces his brother, the strong defending champion, and strives for the chance to enter the finals.<br>In the first game, Cess was average, scoring 1 of 7 shots and scoring only 3 points. But Seth said, “It’s normal, the shooter’s state will fluctuate,” just like his brother’s tone.<br>So in the second game today, Ces-Curie played for 29 minutes. At the last critical moment, the coach still gave him great confidence. He stayed on the court until the last moment and hit a three-point point point that would bring victory to the team. He was firm and confident.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/11/Seth-Curie's stubbornness and pursuit, and the horror projection genes of the Curie family/6ede9afbd3d240de946132542f2a8f8e.jpg" alt="Seth-Curie&#39;s stubbornness and pursuit, and the horror projection genes of the Curie family"><br>​<br>In 29 minutes, Seth made 5 of 9 shots, 4 of 3-point 7 shots, 16 points, 1 rebound, 2 assists and 4 steals. Even the four steals were taken from my brother Stephen.<br>One of the most classic snatches is Seth, who is blocked by a dream, catches up with his brother desperately behind him, and then snatches the ball from behind. The expression on Stephen Cooley’s face was intriguing when the camera was given to Stephen after the robbery.<br>It was like Seth’s pursuit of Stephen throughout his career. Even though he was blocked and torn apart by fate, he still accelerated to catch up with his brother from behind, to catch up with his brother on the stage of the Western Finals, and to face off with his brother in the presence of his parents and family.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/11/Seth-Curie's stubbornness and pursuit, and the horror projection genes of the Curie family/a876d2efdfc942fbbd49f3c3b33d81d6.jpg" alt="Seth-Curie&#39;s stubbornness and pursuit, and the horror projection genes of the Curie family"><br>​</p>

He knows what better to do to win."></a>Brother doesn’t have to shoot in response. He knows what better to do to win.</h1><p>Of course, it was Stephen Cooley and his Golden State Warriors who won the game.<br>Seth Curie played his part, but Stephen Curie was still in charge of all the situations at the end of the game. Curie made only one mistake in the last half of the season when he was snatched from the front by Seth Curie.<br>For the rest of the time, Kuri’s machine-like brain ran at high speed, looking for pioneer holes, and then spared no effort to attack.<br>Stephen did not respond to Seth Curie’s three-point goal, but was always looking for the best chance for the team to win.<br>For example, he made concealed mid-shots, such as his layups through his brother’s and Leonard’s defenses, such as his killing assists to chase the Dream Sky Basketball.<br>Stephen took away the victory, but Seth can leave with absolute pride. He has demonstrated his ability on this supreme stage. His powerful three-point ability shows the horrible projection gene of the Curie family.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/11/Seth-Curie's stubbornness and pursuit, and the horror projection genes of the Curie family/859d8bb6b65840a5b023013c02fc7083.jpg" alt="Seth-Curie&#39;s stubbornness and pursuit, and the horror projection genes of the Curie family"><br>​<br>Maybe it’s just an ordinary Western Final for Stephen Cooley, but Seth is standing in front of him after crossing mountains and rivers.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/11/Seth-Curie's stubbornness and pursuit, and the horror projection genes of the Curie family/dbe24d55812e49979fd04ddd9dffe0e6.jpg" alt="Seth-Curie&#39;s stubbornness and pursuit, and the horror projection genes of the Curie family"><br>​<br>The game may be won or lost, but for the Kuri family who watched the match on the sidelines, there is absolutely no loser today.</p>

Maybe not James, but a super striker/bf67a1aedd1b40dab598b5c4a09a973a.jpg" alt="The NBA is an all-round player. Maybe not James, but a super striker"><br>​<br>It has been more than 70 years since the establishment of the NBA in New York in 1946. During these 70 years, the NBA has produced too many talented people.<br>Because of the previous position differentiation of the NBA, players in all positions should have their own responsibilities. Only by doing their own work can the whole team become strong.<br>But in fact, the talent gap is that some players can achieve 2-3 positions, or even 5 positions can be proficient, this type of player is also the pronoun of NBA omnipotence.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/08/The NBA is an all-round player. Maybe not James, but a super striker/a0375d0b75eb43958e1b92e9d3313475.jpg" alt="The NBA is an all-round player. Maybe not James, but a super striker"><br>​<br>In today’s league, the most versatile player must be LeBron James, who can maintain a career average of 27 + 7 + 7. James can play the role of point guard. He also plays the role of main point guard most of his career. Perhaps only the specific position of point guard is James. Weak, but his scoring ability is still outstanding. The most needed breakthrough ability in the position of small forward is LeBron’s strongest aspect. The position of big forward and center, James has many top positions in the small lineup, even if not so perfect, but with his size can not drag back legs.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/08/The NBA is an all-round player. Maybe not James, but a super striker/6cf6833f961d422b8c56dd8bd240ed51.jpg" alt="The NBA is an all-round player. Maybe not James, but a super striker"><br>​<br>In our broad sense, omnipotence means omnipotence on the court, scoring and tandem defense. In this respect, James, who has been selected five times to defend one batch, has been in the forefront of the League for years with high scoring efficiency and assists.<br>But that’s James. His data on the blocked cap is just average.<br>Blocks are more dominated by the interior, while steals are more dominated by guards. James’s total number of blockades in his career is 921, and his current ranking is still outside the top 100 in history.<br>With such a player, his five main data points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocked caps are ranked in the top 50 in history, which is not a super versatile player? This player is Kevin Garnett, Wolf King.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/08/The NBA is an all-round player. Maybe not James, but a super striker/263d4dc835ac421fb370d90e1c4fbc67.jpg" alt="The NBA is an all-round player. Maybe not James, but a super striker"><br>​<br>In fact, Garnett’s omnipotence has long been circulated in the league. In 2000-2005, Garnett averaged at least 21 points, 11 rebounds and 5 assists in six consecutive seasons, keeping this super data for six seasons, and still as an interior line, which makes people lament Garnett’s omnipotence. At that time, it was quite rare for center power forward to average 5 assists per season, let alone maintain the same level for six consecutive seasons.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/08/The NBA is an all-round player. Maybe not James, but a super striker/129dc5307cd6427da3ac03d7ed0d0ce2.jpg" alt="The NBA is an all-round player. Maybe not James, but a super striker"><br>​<br>Garnett is also a good offensive and defensive player. His backward jumper seems to be a different kind of big forward. His rebounding ability is particularly prominent because of his long arm. His assisting ability has a lot to do with the ball he has trained since childhood. His blocking ability is his guardian ability. In fact, stealing is his defense. Area fits, his defensive area covers almost the entire half-court, and his flexible movement speed gives him such ability.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/08/The NBA is an all-round player. Maybe not James, but a super striker/c56bf81fde6d4f5696678fdc690b5229.jpg" alt="The NBA is an all-round player. Maybe not James, but a super striker"><br>​<br>Garnett’s total career score is 26071, ranking 17th in history, 14662 career rebounds, ranking 9th in history, 5445 career assists. This figure can rank 49th in history, 1859 career steals, 18th in history, career blocks. The total number is 2037, ranking 18th in history.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/08/The NBA is an all-round player. Maybe not James, but a super striker/43521d4bee224ddda1376f92eb09a0d1.jpg" alt="The NBA is an all-round player. Maybe not James, but a super striker"><br>​<br>These five main data are located in the top 50 of history, which is the only one in the history of the NBA more than 70 years ago. Four of them are still in the top 20. Garnett is known as one of the most versatile power forward in history, which is not necessarily an empty breeze.</p>

    <title>The Warriors were in danger when Clay fell, but his re-explosion was the main reason for the Raptors&#39;reversal</title>
    <url>/2019/08/05/The%20Warriors%20were%20in%20danger%20when%20Clay%20fell,%20but%20his%20re-explosion%20was%20the%20main%20reason%20for%20the%20Raptors&#39;reversal/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/05/The Warriors were in danger when Clay fell, but his re-explosion was the main reason for the Raptors'reversal/e4c1e7eb6c8746d68fc8d14c3c725ec8.jpg" alt="The Warriors were in danger when Clay fell, but his re-explosion was the main reason for the Raptors&#39;reversal"><br>​</p>
<h1 id="G6-Clay’s-arrival-on-schedule-and-Clay’s-fall"><a href="#G6-Clay’s-arrival-on-schedule-and-Clay’s-fall" class="headerlink" title="G6 Clay’s arrival on schedule and Clay’s fall"></a>G6 Clay’s arrival on schedule and Clay’s fall</h1><p>The whole world knows that the G6 Clay is bound to break out, and the G6 Clay, as expected, arrived on the stage of the finals.<br>Even if the Raptors had done enough to deal with Clay, they did not let the shorter Lorry go with Clay, but chose to use the taller Leonard.<br>In fact, this strategy of the Raptors really played a role in the opening, Clay did not even get too many offensive opportunities in the opening.<br>But the Raptors’defensive strategy also has its drawbacks. They sent Leonard, who is tall, long-arm and excellent in co-defending interference ability, to defend Clay, and the interior showed a lot of flaws.<br>So some of the warriors’attacks in the opening arena are almost always under the basket with the ball. The Raptors did miss a lot of opportunities in the paint area and near the basket.<br>This is obviously not what the Raptors want to see, even though they made a good start with Lori’s personal superpower, but the emptiness of the interior will make the Warriors score easier, which may cause more serious consequences.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/05/The Warriors were in danger when Clay fell, but his re-explosion was the main reason for the Raptors'reversal/e635fa7b345e4525af91132b93cde341.jpg" alt="The Warriors were in danger when Clay fell, but his re-explosion was the main reason for the Raptors&#39;reversal"><br>​<br>The consequences actually came very quickly, and when Clay put the first three points in, and it was just not an opportunity, the Raptors’defensive front was clearly in trouble.<br>And Clay’s firepower is continuing to explode. In the past, Clay only carried out the team’s tactics, running without the ball, then shooting firmly at a fixed point, or shaking off the opponent’s three-point, artistic shooting performance.<br>But why does Clay always mention G6, more because Clay will change his playing style in some key games, he will use more ball-free attacks.<br>Clay’s dribbling seems to have been criticized, but in fact, as long as he ends off the three-point line or mid-range, his basic skill is that few players in the league can match him.<br>So Klein of G6 has the determination to hold the ball directly and use his teammates to block and disassemble the shot outside the three-point line. He also has the smart choice to retreat after a breakthrough and take a long-distance two-point step. When Klein can shoot from anywhere and seriously threaten the opponent’s defense, he becomes extremely terrible.<br>Such Clay Thompson may only have a basket in his eyes, but his shooting concentration is significantly higher. In the Warriors team basketball system, Clay often assists his teammates, but in times of desperation, he deserves any trust from his teammates.<br>Today’s game is the same, Clay’s 32-minute appearance time, 0 assists, all his purpose is to put that damn ball into the basket or dunk, just like his fast break choice before the injury left the field.<br>Fast break, that’s the Warriors’favorite way. All through the playoffs, the Warriors expect to be able to change the game by speeding up, but in the entire Finals against the Raptors, the Warriors only did so once in G2.<br>But today’s Warriors had a chance to play a continuous offensive climax in the third quarter to open up the score. In that fast break, Clay tried to attack the basket. He wanted to boost morale through a dunk, or even cause 2 + 1, which might make the Oracle Museum noise of the decibel blast machine.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/05/The Warriors were in danger when Clay fell, but his re-explosion was the main reason for the Raptors'reversal/61e490a968f4475e9dbd8c9bde8f4599.jpg" alt="The Warriors were in danger when Clay fell, but his re-explosion was the main reason for the Raptors&#39;reversal"><br>​<br>But when he landed, the unbalanced left leg landed on one leg, and there was a significant bend, which made him fall painfully, and also made the exciting fans of Oracle Hall breathe.<br>The Warriors were still in the lead when Clay was injured and left the field, but in such a hot state, Klein was injured and eventually was injured, which was of course a huge blow to the Warriors.<br>Moreover, this is the Warriors’key players in two consecutive games, but after the last Durant left the field, Cosins suddenly broke out to save the Warriors. In today’s game, Clay’s departure seems to have put the Warriors in a state of collective frustration.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/05/The Warriors were in danger when Clay fell, but his re-explosion was the main reason for the Raptors'reversal/f286ece08b4248e084275c87d3fdde38.jpg" alt="The Warriors were in danger when Clay fell, but his re-explosion was the main reason for the Raptors&#39;reversal"><br>​</p>
<h1 id="At-the-stage-of-Clay’s-departure-Curie-failed-to-pull-the-warriors-out-of-despair"><a href="#At-the-stage-of-Clay’s-departure-Curie-failed-to-pull-the-warriors-out-of-despair" class="headerlink" title="At the stage of Clay’s departure, Curie failed to pull the warriors out of despair."></a>At the stage of Clay’s departure, Curie failed to pull the warriors out of despair.</h1><p>Even with a serious cruciate ligament tear, Clay is still trying to get back on the pitch.<br>On his way back to the dressing room, Clay even returned to the game and executed two free throws. According to the rules, if the injured player does not execute the free throw and commits a direct foul in the dressing room, he will not be able to enter the game after returning from the dressing room.<br>So Clay chose to take these two free throws on his own, and his mind was to go back to the dressing room and do a little bit of processing and then continue the game.<br>But the end result was so cruel that when the injury was dealt with, Clay could only walk on crutches and stagger away from Oracle in the most unacceptable way.<br>After Clay left, the Raptors naturally used Box-one tactics against Curie again.<br>The Box-one of G2 was a sudden fantasy of the Raptors and a genius attempt of coach Nass. It worked wonderfully and they almost won the game.<br>Today’s Box-one should be the Warriors’expectation, but it can be seen that Clay’s departure makes the Warriors’ response somewhat weak.<br>Box-one tactic is to completely limit the play of Curie. The defensive attention of the Raptors is focused on one person, and the defense he suffers is also the highest level.<br>However, Curie still did not grasp several fleeting opportunities, such as the three points after the block, and the rare successful tactics of the Warriors at the last minute gave him the chance to kill.<br>After Clay left the field until the end of the game, Curie scored only four points, shooting 6 shots 1, 3 points only 4 shots 0.<br>Naturally, we don’t know why Curie’s game is so fluctuant. When Oracle Stadium and the Warriors were desperate for this victory, he didn’t show his best.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/05/The Warriors were in danger when Clay fell, but his re-explosion was the main reason for the Raptors'reversal/24eab135941c4f82b24489202b9327f0.jpg" alt="The Warriors were in danger when Clay fell, but his re-explosion was the main reason for the Raptors&#39;reversal"><br>​<br>But when Clay was injured, he beat the ball angrily and eventually fell into the vault at the bottom corner of the other end of the court. It must be quite complicated. The Warriors have done everything for the three consecutive championships, but they still lost a lot, which seems to be a pity and cruel.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/05/The Warriors were in danger when Clay fell, but his re-explosion was the main reason for the Raptors'reversal/3ae1ab464cb34f7e8e3aac17b185f575.jpg" alt="The Warriors were in danger when Clay fell, but his re-explosion was the main reason for the Raptors&#39;reversal"><br>​</p>
<h1 id="Van-Friedt’s-explosion-brought-momentum-back-to-the-Raptors"><a href="#Van-Friedt’s-explosion-brought-momentum-back-to-the-Raptors" class="headerlink" title="Van Friedt’s explosion brought momentum back to the Raptors"></a>Van Friedt’s explosion brought momentum back to the Raptors</h1><p>In fact, at the end of the third quarter, the Warriors still led the Raptors by two points to the fourth quarter, even though they lost one of their generals.<br>In this level of competition, the difference between two points can decide everything, but the Raptors understand that their chances are coming.<br>It was not Leonard, the core player they had always relied on, that helped the Raptors to pull the situation back completely. It was not Lori, who played bravely in the first half of the game, but Van Friet, who was only 1.83 meters tall.<br>Fantastic Van Friedt from the Eastern Finals series to the finals stage, the old draft almost let his name shine throughout the basketball world.<br>When his children finally croaked to the ground, Van Friedt unloaded the heaviest burden on his mind and began to truly release his best sixth man of the Raptors.<br>On the defensive side, he has done his best in the whole series of defensive games, and Kury has hardly got any advantage under Van Friet’s defense.<br>On the offensive side, Van Friedt averaged 14 points in the Finals, undoubtedly the top scorer in both teams, and he also averaged 6.7 points with a 40% shooting percentage, hitting 2.7 of them.<br>Throughout the Finals, his performance outside the three-point line was only second to that of the energetic Clay Thompson.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/05/The Warriors were in danger when Clay fell, but his re-explosion was the main reason for the Raptors'reversal/0a789488f1204ef6b2b82aa35207fff5.jpg" alt="The Warriors were in danger when Clay fell, but his re-explosion was the main reason for the Raptors&#39;reversal"><br>​<br>In the fourth quarter, Van Friedt made three-point fouls from five shots outside the three-point line, scoring 12 points in total and 12 points out of 28 for the Raptors. This single-point resurgence has begun to shift the momentum towards the Raptors.<br>The Warriors also have three points for Dream Chasing and Brother, but they lack the most important three points for Curie. Under the continuous encirclement and interception of two or even three Raptors, Curie’s chances of even shooting are very difficult to get.<br>Van Friedt, Van Friedt and Ibaka, Siakam, etc. made the Warriors’defense exhausted, and their many attacking points were not interfered too much by the Warriors’ defense.<br>Van Friedt averaged only 14 points per game in the Finals, but in fact, most of his goals were fairly hard-headed response balls, power kicks or fairy balls that were about to arrive in 23 seconds.<br>This kind of goal, which ignores any pressure and defense, is the most inspiring goal. In the farewell battle of the Warriors Oracle Stadium, such golden goals will really hit the opponent’s morale.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/05/The Warriors were in danger when Clay fell, but his re-explosion was the main reason for the Raptors'reversal/532bae4fc55146d48792c1d6008afdd7.jpg" alt="The Warriors were in danger when Clay fell, but his re-explosion was the main reason for the Raptors&#39;reversal"><br>​<br>Of course Leonard is strong, Lori is also the core of the team’s absolute exterior line, but Van Fritt’s outbreak, which is not overly valued by the Warriors, this unexpected play of the opponents, has become a decisive variable in the game.<br>That’s the key for the Raptors to really reverse the game and win.</p>

His three-point shooting rate has dropped again and again to a low of 31.<br>Even in the past, Green’s defense, which has been able to gain a foothold in the league, seems to have declined significantly in the regular season.<br>However, since entering the playoffs, the performance of pursuing dreams has indeed ushered in a comprehensive rebound. This change has made the Warriors steadfastly come to the stage of the Western Conference even though they have encountered many difficulties.<br>After two rounds of training, the Golden State Warriors are now holding the Western Finals, one step away from the fifth consecutive Finals.<br>In this process, Dream Green averaged 13.3 points, 9.5 rebounds and 8.0 assists, in addition to 1.27 steals and 1.67 blocked shots.<br>Dream-chasing three-point shooting has also been actively reduced. The proportion of basketball impact and fast break in his personal offense has increased significantly. The shooting percentage of 52.3% is significantly higher than that of 44.5% in the regular season.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/14/The chattering Green disappeared, and back came the healthy, focused DPOY/e5de3fec04954305801b69d064cd2876.jpg" alt="The chattering Green disappeared, and back came the healthy, focused DPOY"><br>​<br>Of course, there is no reason for this change. The reason why Dream Chasing can magically regain DPOY status in the past few years is closely related to his weight loss in the regular season.<br>Warrior GM Bob Miles and Warrior Team found their dreams in March and gave their personal advice on weight loss, body recovery, and proper diet.<br>So the whole team of warriors began to make plans for Dream Chasing Green, and Dream Chasing began to follow and implement.<br>There are special dietitians to guide dream-chasing diet, dream-chasing menus and menus provided by special chefs. Team strength trainers formulate detailed training plans for dream-chasing, so that he can keep up with strength training while losing weight.<br>In six weeks, before the playoffs, Chasing Dream Green lost 23 pounds through this program, and also adjusted to the best physical condition for the playoffs.<br>Therefore, we saw the healthy and light dream-chasing Green break out when the team faced difficulties in the Warriors’Western Final against Trail Blazers G3.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/14/The chattering Green disappeared, and back came the healthy, focused DPOY/f445c46ee13c4569af65c05e749f915b.jpg" alt="The chattering Green disappeared, and back came the healthy, focused DPOY"><br>​<br>Chasing Dream got three pairs of data at the end of three quarters, and cut 20 points, 13 baskets, 12 assists, 4 steals and 1 cover in the whole game. His figure was almost everywhere.<br>Chasing Dream Green’s perfect performance in the third quarter also helped the double-digit Golden State Warriors complete the second consecutive single-quarter reversal of the third quarter.<br>Chasing Dream Green’s “internal combustion engine” energy is perfectly converted into the Warriors’engine, even if there are some breakdowns, but the Warriors’ power is still full, their “core parts” are still running smoothly, which is an important reason why they are currently overwhelmed in the Western Decision.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/14/The chattering Green disappeared, and back came the healthy, focused DPOY/473d5bdca4784f88988d9594479339b7.jpg" alt="The chattering Green disappeared, and back came the healthy, focused DPOY"><br>​<br>The energy provided by pursuing dreams is the premise of all this. Dream-chasing health, as a prerequisite for his energy, comes from that crucial suggestion and that important weight loss.<br>Speaking of this year’s playoffs, Durant’s right calf, a brother’s left calf, Clay’s ankle, Curie’s ankle and finger dislocation, Cosins thigh, the Warriors in addition to dream, other core members are more or less affected by injuries.<br>At this moment, the health of pursuing dreams and their exertion are more important. His existence makes the three-time championship of the warriors go forward steadily, though bumpy.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/14/The chattering Green disappeared, and back came the healthy, focused DPOY/d78a29cbe393444296a11b011191c8b3.jpg" alt="The chattering Green disappeared, and back came the healthy, focused DPOY"><br>​<br>** Enlightenment of Children’s Words on Dream Pursuit**<br>The 2016 champion’s regretful mistake plunged the entire Warriors team into deep self-blame and reflection, including Dream Chasing Green.<br>In the summer of 2016, Chasing Dream Green also formed a group of his personal network, which was used to provide some business, professional and personal life advice for Chasing Dream.<br>This group of close relatives, friends and industry leaders who pursue dreams has actually helped them grow up a lot.<br>What’s more, after that, chasing dreams also ushered in the birth of his son. The existence of children makes the dream of becoming a father feel heavy responsibility again.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/14/The chattering Green disappeared, and back came the healthy, focused DPOY/7438487097464f27bf970d366e246d77.jpg" alt="The chattering Green disappeared, and back came the healthy, focused DPOY"><br>​<br>In today’s interview, Dreamchase also mentioned, “The influence of the NBA is really great. Many children will watch the game. They regard us as idols. Our behavior has a great impact on them. After that, I will be cautious about my behavior on the court and not lead the children in the wrong direction.<br>The biggest teacher for children is actually their parents, who consciously or unconsciously imitate their parents’behavior. As their children grow up, their language and behavior learning abilities become stronger and stronger, and their imitation and learning of their parents will become deeper and deeper.<br>When their children still learn some irrational behavior on the court, they begin to realize their mistakes.<br>So Dreamchase began to control his emotions, as he said, not to argue too much with the referee, but to focus more quickly on the next round of the game.<br>When the mood is the most unstable, the easiest to erupt and sometimes hurt the team’s dream-chasing Green, when he starts to become extremely calm and self-restrained, the Golden State Warriors will become dangerous, will become highly disciplined, they will rarely make fatal mistakes, so they will be stronger.<br>Children’s words bring enlightenment and growth to the pursuit of dreams, which is certainly the scene that the Warriors are most happy to see. After all, because of technical fouls and banned from the game, they have eaten once, naturally do not want to fall twice in the same pit.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/14/The chattering Green disappeared, and back came the healthy, focused DPOY/ca9ea9e606684a83ad5ad1401173d366.jpg" alt="The chattering Green disappeared, and back came the healthy, focused DPOY"><br>​<br>** Spiritual Encouragement of Dream Chasing for Team<br>Self-control does not mean no emotional release. Dream-chasing is one of the most passionate players in the league. When he learns to calm down, he knows more clearly when emotional release will have the greatest positive impact on the team.<br>In the fourth quarter of the G5 Tianwangshan Battle, the 3-minute dream hit and the roar that lasted for 5-6 seconds made all the warriors, even more than 20,000 spectators of Oracle Stadium, awake when Durant was injured and left the arena in a state of panic.<br>Yeah, the Warriors lack Durant, but there’s still the core team they’ve been proud of. This spiritual strength prompted the Warriors to regain their focus, including Stephen Curie.<br>And when Stephen Cooley regains his old bow-and-arrow status, any defensive opponent will feel chilled, and they will try their best to limit Cooley.<br>Now, Kuri, who has gone through too many tests, is quite calm in the face of this kind of package. He always finds his most trusted dream-chasing Green in various ways.<br>When Curie attracts the most powerful defensive attention in the past, the Warriors have a great chance to find the loopholes of less defensive opponents in the running of Dreamchase Scheduling.<br>In the series against Trail Blazers, none of them can really play against Green. Green has a lot of space to play, whether on the offensive side or on the defensive side. His thorough activation and Kuri’s hot state, as well as their mutual understanding to the extreme of cooperation, so that the warriors can really become invincible.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/14/The chattering Green disappeared, and back came the healthy, focused DPOY/9e4e37f91b344f3faa41131b3b511717.jpg" alt="The chattering Green disappeared, and back came the healthy, focused DPOY"><br>​<br>Staying healthy and having a calmer mind may be the best dream chase ever seen by Warriors and the league in the past few years.</p>

    <title>The free market in the NBA is so popular that Zhou Qi&#39;s action shows his determination to return to the NBA</title>
    <url>/2019/08/20/The%20free%20market%20in%20the%20NBA%20is%20so%20popular%20that%20Zhou%20Qi&#39;s%20action%20shows%20his%20determination%20to%20return%20to%20the%20NBA/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/20/The free market in the NBA is so popular that Zhou Qi's action shows his determination to return to the NBA/8cc48925dd394bc29f2b691b7d0c8052.jpg" alt="The free market in the NBA is so popular that Zhou Qi&#39;s action shows his determination to return to the NBA"><br>​<br>Zhou Qi’s recent news is quite a lot, and most of the content is negative. The most remarkable thing is that Wang Shipeng, the eldest brother of Chinese basketball, openly criticized Zhou Qi on Weibo.<br>Wang Shipeng, as a meritorious task of Chinese basketball, is also a representative of the golden generation of 08. Of course, he has a very high position in the domestic basketball circle. Although he did not mention Zhou Qi in his micro-blog, his words imply Zhou Qi’s identity.<br>Later, according to reporters, the chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association and the Chinese basketball coaching team also intervened in the incident and mediated the emotions of both sides. In Wang Shipeng’s subsequent update of the micro-blog, Zhou Qi has been directly @ and the time of this contradiction has also been concluded.<br>But the incident itself is somewhat strange. Zhou Qi, the central figure of the incident, did leave a bad impression on people.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/20/The free market in the NBA is so popular that Zhou Qi's action shows his determination to return to the NBA/16779e7d256945af8674316750a48d83.jpg" alt="The free market in the NBA is so popular that Zhou Qi&#39;s action shows his determination to return to the NBA"><br>​</p>
<h1 id="The-reason-is-late-and-unprovoked-breaking-an-appointment"><a href="#The-reason-is-late-and-unprovoked-breaking-an-appointment" class="headerlink" title="The reason is late and unprovoked breaking an appointment."></a>The reason is late and unprovoked breaking an appointment.</h1><p>“Eventually know why you can’t play the NBA”, “Rockets are afraid to cultivate a superstar bigger than Paul and Harden”, “basketball circle has been mixed for so many years, the first time to see such a big brand”. These words have expressed Wang Shipeng’s outrage.<br>Most importantly, Wang Shipeng also mentioned the following sentence: “I can’t believe what I heard before”, which is very interesting.<br>What would have happened to those things that I had heard before? Some fans must still remember the 2016 Rio Olympics, when Zhou Qi also represented China in the Olympic Games.<br>In the whole group tournament of the Olympic Games, the whole Chinese team has not won because of its inferior skills, and the gap of strength has indeed emerged in this high-level competition.<br>This result is not surprising to the domestic fans, but Zhou Qi’s pride was also reflected in the match against Serbia.<br>In a Serbian attack, two of the other side’s inside lines were covered up, and Zhou Qi and Yi Jianlian had some problems in the exchange of defense, which ended with Zhou Qi’s failure to converge after rushing out.<br>After this round, Zhou Qi and Yi Jianlian have some communication, but the picture can clearly see that Zhou Qi’s mouth said, “This can also blame me me”.<br>In fact, we don’t need to discuss who’s wrong in this round, but Yi Jianlian is the absolute core of the national team. Rio Olympic Games scored an average of 20.4 points per game to set the career Olympic Games average score record. Zhou Qi at that time, fearing confrontation, drifted outside shooting, averaging 5.2 points and 1.2 rebounds per game, was obviously too much. Too young.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/20/The free market in the NBA is so popular that Zhou Qi's action shows his determination to return to the NBA/68553f0547294bc891689c30ebb8d5ae.jpg" alt="The free market in the NBA is so popular that Zhou Qi&#39;s action shows his determination to return to the NBA"><br>​</p>

The Rockets have been careful and patient with Zhou Qi, but Zhou Qi still failed to meet the expectations of the Rockets.<br>Therefore, it is inevitable to leave the NBA, but Zhou Qi’s off-court attitude during the NBA is still relatively general. No matter any player in the NBA, even sitting on the bench, he has to help the team prepare. And his phrase “I didn’t expect the coach to send me on the pitch, I wasn’t ready” is obviously not professional enough to cope with and prepare.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/20/The free market in the NBA is so popular that Zhou Qi's action shows his determination to return to the NBA/77a85be7bd5149c9b4f46b2c89f606ac.jpg" alt="The free market in the NBA is so popular that Zhou Qi&#39;s action shows his determination to return to the NBA"><br>​<br>Recently, according to domestic basketball reporters, Zhou Qi has split up with U.S. agent O’Connor, and he is trying to find a new U.S. agent.<br>It’s not clear whether Zhou Qi will return to the United States, but he can only take the World Cup as a last chance to show off. He must perform strongly in order to win at least the chance for himself.<br>In terms of ability, not only his talent and growth, but also his preparation and attitude towards professional competition, which is what Zhou Qi really needs to improve.</p>

    <title>The key three points kill the game! In 36 minutes, he cut 25 + 4 + 6, and he almost rowed in the first three quarters</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The heat challenge the Lakers away. The heat beat the Suns away in the last game, which was back-to-back, physical strength was a problem, and Winslow didn’t play yet. The Lakers are waiting for work. They have just won three games in a row away from home. They have won six games in a row. Their morale is high. Theoretically, they have a chance to win seven games in a row.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/11/The key three points kill the game! In 36 minutes, he cut 25 + 4 + 6, and he almost rowed in the first three quarters/48248038ffd84aa9af8062c24aa4da94.jpg" alt="The key three points kill the game! In 36 minutes, he cut 25 + 4 + 6, and he almost rowed in the first three quarters"><br>At the beginning of the game, the Lakers played a wave of 11-2, mainly showing a lot of aggression at the defensive end, only playing for more than 2 minutes, the Lakers sent out three blocks, thick eyebrows sent out, two times directly to the outside line, giving the heat a lot of defensive pressure outside the line, while Butler in the tangle of Dani green, has not yet received the ball. The Lakers haven’t attacked much, mainly because there are a lot of opportunities here in Bradley. He can shoot three points at a fixed point, can hold the ball and shoot with cover. James and bushmei haven’t started yet. The Lakers have played a good start advantage.<br>After drajic came back, the heat had an extra attack point, Butler also increased his personal attack, the Lakers threw a bad three-point shot, the difference was quickly caught up. Generally speaking, the shooting rate of the long-range projection of both sides in the first quarter was very poor. The Lakers’ pop and Kuzma didn’t make much contribution after coming on as substitutes. Caruso provided a strong defense and a smash dunk. In the first quarter, the Lakers and the heat were 28-21, and Howard didn’t get a chance in the first quarter.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/11/The key three points kill the game! In 36 minutes, he cut 25 + 4 + 6, and he almost rowed in the first three quarters/ad12ae3dc0f74052b983ecd7281c93c0.jpg" alt="The key three points kill the game! In 36 minutes, he cut 25 + 4 + 6, and he almost rowed in the first three quarters"><br>In the next quarter, James played a very smooth attack with the substitute, and every player was willing to share the ball. But the heat made two three-point shots on the outside line in a row, and Dragic attacked in series, bringing the difference close to three points. James didn’t come out in time to score, but kept passing the ball to his teammates. Even if there was a vacancy, he didn’t throw it. The basketball seemed to play well.<br>After Caruso came off the court, the Lakers began to lose their offense, and they didn’t play a good attack and defense conversion when they were in the thick eyebrows. In the last three minutes, the Lakers changed Howard into a small team, but they didn’t play a relatively good attack. James still didn’t start the attack mode. He was passing the ball all the time and organizing the attack all the time. The heat had a lot of opportunities, but fortunately, the hit rate was not high. The Lakers still had two points before the end of the half, playing 46-48.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/11/The key three points kill the game! In 36 minutes, he cut 25 + 4 + 6, and he almost rowed in the first three quarters/a50593a57c3746549c2f74447a6f0a29.jpg" alt="The key three points kill the game! In 36 minutes, he cut 25 + 4 + 6, and he almost rowed in the first three quarters"><br>In the third quarter of the game, the Lakers started to improve the defense intensity. In almost half of the game, the heat only got 4 points. Although James was still rowing, he didn’t play as hard as before, but he occasionally snapped a lift. The Lakers mainly relied on the conversion of attack and defense to expand the comparative advantage to 8 points.<br>James was fouled maliciously by Leonard in a breakthrough, and was slapped directly. It’s estimated that he could not hold his face after he was kicked off by James in front, and wanted to revenge. But after the foul, the Lakers were more aggressive, the defense was more fierce, James was also more aggressive, the bottom corner into three points, the difference opened to 11 points. In the last three minutes, Vogel replaced Kuzma, still without Howard, put Kuzma and pop on the court, the defense was worse, but fortunately, under the guidance of bushmei, he did not lose points in this period. At the end of the third section, the two sides played 78-66.<br>At the end of the game, the Lakers dropped two main players and used the team that beat the bulls in the fourth quarter, Howard + Kuzma + kaluso and other pure substitutes, but this time it was not so easy. Dragic scored five points in a row, two rounds, one and a half minutes to stop the Lakers, and Vogel had to change back to James to stabilize the rhythm.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/11/The key three points kill the game! In 36 minutes, he cut 25 + 4 + 6, and he almost rowed in the first three quarters/e5ebbdefe7fb40ed9ff6e79499ea7638.jpg" alt="The key three points kill the game! In 36 minutes, he cut 25 + 4 + 6, and he almost rowed in the first three quarters"><br>In the last five minutes of the last quarter, the Lakers replaced Howard, went to a relatively small lineup, bushbrow + James + three guards, and Caruso increased the defensive strength and holding points. Butler was consumed a little seriously, and the Lakers as a whole stabilized the difference at 8 points. In about two minutes, James scored two three-point shots, extending the difference to 15 points, basically killing the game. Interestingly, the heat and the bulls have one thing in common in this game, that is, in the last period of time, the Lakers’ high-intensity defense made the heat fail to score in nearly 7 minutes. By defense, the Lakers won 7 consecutive games, and the two sides finally achieved 95-80.<br>In the whole game, James played 36 minutes, 10 of 19 shots, 7 of 3 shots, 4 of 7 shots, got 25 + 4 + 6, 3 mistakes, plus or minus value + 16, James didn’t play well in the first three quarters, and his desire was not very strong, but he stood out in the fourth quarter, especially the two key three points, which became the direct factor to end the game. In 11 of 17 shots, bushmei got 26 points, 8 rebounds, 7 assists, 2 steals, 3 blocks and 2 mistakes, with a positive and negative value of + 27. There is basically no player in the inner line of the heat who can limit bushmei. The inner line score is too easy. The heat’s strategy for him is not to let him go to the paint area. In addition, it’s a free throw, isn’t it?<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/11/The key three points kill the game! In 36 minutes, he cut 25 + 4 + 6, and he almost rowed in the first three quarters/dac21a80a47740758928611e3fb9124a.jpg" alt="The key three points kill the game! In 36 minutes, he cut 25 + 4 + 6, and he almost rowed in the first three quarters"><br>Butler only got 22 points in this game. The defense of the Lakers’ outside line and front line was too much for him. He only played twice in the last critical moment, and didn’t go out at all in the rest of the time. Bradley, Denny green and Caruso from the outside line defended him in a wheel game. He was waiting for him when he went to the inside line.<br>Finally know, the Lakers defense efficiency, why is the League first.</p>

Woj followed up that Corzins suffered a knee injury caused by a collision with a man during training in Las Vegas on Monday, local time.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/09/The most enduring stars in NBA history, the top real iron man, James can only barely make the list/43d9437e0903474bbaeda843204b2358.jpg" alt="The most enduring stars in NBA history, the top real iron man, James can only barely make the list"><br>​<br>It’s the third major injury Cosins has suffered in nearly two years. Compared with Achilles tendon rupture and cruciate ligament tear, the quadriceps thigh tear in the playoffs this year is not even worth mentioning.<br>Yes, Achilles tendon and cruciate ligament injuries are the top two most serious injuries that affect the career of professional athletes in the United States. These two injuries, which Cosins has experienced for two years, are regrettable and heartbreaking.<br>Competitive sports are cruel. Cousins’successive injuries may make him fade out of the League soon. Perhaps the biggest enemy of professional players on the field is not the opponent standing opposite the court, but the relentless injury.<br>Injuries, in the NBA destroyed too many geniuses, Cosins injured before, as if there have been many calls for the league’s first center, but after the injury, until now, he can only use the base salary to fight for their own opportunities. Such examples are not uncommon in the long history of the NBA.<br>Similarly, relatively speaking, to be able to enter the NBA from the beginning to reach the top of the League steadily, not only requires the support of talent, a body that can withstand the wind and rain is also essential.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/09/The most enduring stars in NBA history, the top real iron man, James can only barely make the list/386c2b8897214059b749cd1162838699.jpg" alt="The most enduring stars in NBA history, the top real iron man, James can only barely make the list"><br>​<br>Let’s take a look at the statistics today. There are few superstars in the history of the NBA who have been plagued by injuries.<br>Although James suffered a rare injury in his career last season, and missed more than 10 games because of injury, which set a career record, throughout his career, James’s physical endurance is quite high.<br>Too many times I have seen James stamp his foot and grind his teeth after spraining his ankle, and he has missed 98 games in 16 seasons of his career so far because of injury, which is the premise of counting 27 games last season. On the premise of such a healthy enough condition, James’s historical talent has also been well developed, and his present historical position has been accumulated in the 16 years of struggle.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/09/The most enduring stars in NBA history, the top real iron man, James can only barely make the list/7b162a108d6740f79567b710be5d05f6.jpg" alt="The most enduring stars in NBA history, the top real iron man, James can only barely make the list"><br>​<br>Jabbar’s career also lasted for 20 years. In those days when the players’training facilities and physical protection were not systematic, Jabbar’s career length and height were impressive enough.<br>Jabbar’s 20-year career has also made him the NBA’s leading scorer so far, and his 20-year career has only missed 80 games, with an average of only four absences per season. This attendance rate is also terrible.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/09/The most enduring stars in NBA history, the top real iron man, James can only barely make the list/4939123eb94a4e938b378a19353677a0.jpg" alt="The most enduring stars in NBA history, the top real iron man, James can only barely make the list"><br>​<br>Above Jabbar is a pair of partners, Jazz’s famous two-time veterans, Karl-Malone and Stockton’s combination, Karl-Malone’s career in the first 18 seasons, the absence of each season is no more than three, but also 10 seasons to play 82 games, “Postman” is the title, “rain or shine.” Postman always serves in time.<br>Stockton was even more horrible, with 17 full-time seasons in 19 seasons of his career, of which 16 played 82 games, which also created his history of assisting king honor, accumulated over the years, the result is that.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/09/The most enduring stars in NBA history, the top real iron man, James can only barely make the list/ac475c6e67c24bfe97ab82381882d495.jpg" alt="The most enduring stars in NBA history, the top real iron man, James can only barely make the list"><br>​<br>And the famous iron man in history is not Elvin Hayes. Hayes was elected to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1990. He also had 21 points and 12.5 rebounds in his career. The most amazing thing about him was that in his 16-year career, he had missed only nine games, and the attendance rate was just horrible.</p>

    <title>The new season MVP will be Harden James Or the letter brother Pippen Don&#39;t underestimate this super giant</title>
    <url>/2019/09/17/The%20new%20season%20MVP%20will%20be%20Harden%20James%20Or%20the%20letter%20brother%20Pippen%20Don&#39;t%20underestimate%20this%20super%20giant/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/09/17/The new season MVP will be Harden James Or the letter brother Pippen Don't underestimate this super giant/2549bdfa77ef40e59b0f911c245a8530.jpg" alt="The new season MVP will be Harden James Or the letter brother Pippen Don&#39;t underestimate this super giant"><br>The NBA’s new season, 2019-20 season, from the current point of view, the level of excitement can be really low, there is a newly formed super battleship Los Angeles Clippers, there are also Lakers trying to revitalize the Zijin giants, the western jazz, the eastern 76ers It’s recruiting, and there’s a bit of contending between the East and the West. Of course, from the odds or the lineup, the Clippers are the most promising team to win the championship, but at least the chances of each team have already It has become a lot bigger than before.<br>So, not only is the title of the championship, but the ownership of the MVP will become quite interesting. Can James stay healthy in the new season? If the Clippers get the first record of the league, how to choose? Perhaps it is Joachim who is still making progress? Or is it still Harden who still has super scoring ability? The letter of the couple’s couplet?<br>However, today, when the bull named Pippen was invited to the famous basketball talk show “The Jump” in the United States, he gave different opinions.<br>Pippen mentioned the new season’s Warriors, and the new season’s Stephen Curry.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/09/17/The new season MVP will be Harden James Or the letter brother Pippen Don't underestimate this super giant/5cc5110af71443a2b65d132e973a1744.jpg" alt="The new season MVP will be Harden James Or the letter brother Pippen Don&#39;t underestimate this super giant"><br>“The Warriors have built a culture of winning. Stephen is one of the most difficult defenders in the league.” Pippen said, “I can’t find him the reason why MVP is the hottest. One thing is that he will be the ball.” The team’s only focus, in the past few years, his shooting ability has converged because of the arrival of KD, I think he will return to the level before KD arrived.”<br>In fact, Pippen’s remarks are very interesting. It’s not that he is optimistic about the facts in Curry. In the odds of MVP, Curry is also the top three in the high game. Considering the top teams in the West, James and Chou , George and Leonard match, Wei Shao and Harden match, the superstar’s match will always make them not much advantage in the MVP competition, so if the Warriors get a good record, Curry won the MVP The odds are still relatively large.<br>But the interesting point is not here. In fact, as early as 2016, Pippen three years ago, the attitude towards Curry is far from this.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/09/17/The new season MVP will be Harden James Or the letter brother Pippen Don't underestimate this super giant/dd25499bd18f416b988f97b79939e9e4.jpg" alt="The new season MVP will be Harden James Or the letter brother Pippen Don&#39;t underestimate this super giant"><br>Curry was born in the past to win the championship and MVP. In the second year, he won an unprecedented all-time MVP, but Pippen did not seem to recognize Curry’s all-inclusive MVP. He said in an interview in the same year: In those days, we were two three consecutive championships, and the Warriors, they were still tender, Curry has not reached the point worthy of my worship, do not think he can get a full vote. This is what Jordan does not have.”<br>In 2017, Durant came to the Warriors, and Pippen still did not have much respect for Curry.<br>“Stephen (Curry) is a good player, but not dominant. Yes, he has won two MVPs, but he is not the best player in the Finals, nor the best player in the Warriors.”<br>“Maybe he is very good, a great player,” Pippen continued. “But he doesn’t have dominance.”<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/09/17/The new season MVP will be Harden James Or the letter brother Pippen Don't underestimate this super giant/9df22511c322474fb97eda157f385812.jpg" alt="The new season MVP will be Harden James Or the letter brother Pippen Don&#39;t underestimate this super giant"><br>Then, Curry led the Warriors to the finals five times and won three championships. Curry’s personal level has become more stable and powerful on the stage of the playoffs. Beginning in 18 years, Pippen’s evaluation of Curry has begun to change.<br>“His (Curry) sacrifice for KD is one of the greatest stories in basketball history.” “History has never seen a player like him who forced his opponent to expand to such a degree.” One after another, Pippen’s disdain and contempt for Curry has now turned into respect and recognition. Even Curry’s personal sacrifice has made Pippen admire Curry’s personality.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/09/17/The new season MVP will be Harden James Or the letter brother Pippen Don't underestimate this super giant/748fa34ed89c480882ea7801c14544ac.jpg" alt="The new season MVP will be Harden James Or the letter brother Pippen Don&#39;t underestimate this super giant"><br>When we were accustomed to the behavior of the famous people, the change of Pippen was a very rare thing.</p>

    <title>The pioneer&#39;s defense is a crime, and all the gaps in Kuri&#39;s rise are opportunities</title>

<h1 id="The-pitcher’s-so-called-rhythm-and-feeling"><a href="#The-pitcher’s-so-called-rhythm-and-feeling" class="headerlink" title="The pitcher’s so-called rhythm and feeling"></a>The pitcher’s so-called rhythm and feeling</h1><p>Kuri’s first two three-point shots were all in the front box, and only three of his first nine shots were hit. When people began to worry about Kuri’s finger injuries, Kuri’s first three-point came unexpectedly.<br>The first three points is the familiar Kuri chase false gear removal, and then Kuri around a small bend to the bottom right corner, even though the two Blazers defensive players have noticed Kuri’s movements.<br>But on the one hand, Kuri has too many choices after catching the ball. The pioneer defenders dare not attack and defend easily. On the other hand, they do not make any difficulties for Kuri’s catching. Their pinch may be so slow that 0.5 seconds is enough for Kuri to catch and shoot very quickly and enter the net hollow.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/08/The pioneer's defense is a crime, and all the gaps in Kuri's rise are opportunities/68e32247ecc34527b487aba83c2ed9dd.jpg" alt="The pioneer&#39;s defense is a crime, and all the gaps in Kuri&#39;s rise are opportunities"><br>​<br>Bogut once said, “If you’ve been with different players, some combinations don’t fit, because the players often think,’All the balls pass my hand, I have to control everything. Stephen, however, was willing not to get a chance in three or four minutes because he knew he could open the game with a wave of three or four points.<br>“It was in that situation that he realized:’I need my teammates to be involved as well. So everyone gets better, and that attitude has a ripple effect.<br>The significance of this passage is not only the scoring explosive power of the unique team in the Curie League, but also the basis of the Warriors’team basketball.<br>​<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/08/The pioneer's defense is a crime, and all the gaps in Kuri's rise are opportunities/585f4b53ec2c49299a67cda8a9c0798d.jpg" alt="The pioneer&#39;s defense is a crime, and all the gaps in Kuri&#39;s rise are opportunities"><br>The Blazers were actually quite cautious. They called a timeout immediately after Curry’s first three-point hit. Maybe Coach Stotts was not satisfied with the team’s defense against Curry.<br>But when the first three points of Curie came, they were somewhat irresistible. Especially the eight consecutive points before the end of the midfield, a three-point line outside worship Buddha burst into the inside of the pick-up rebound, a three-point arc top block, the last round of the nearly lost ball after picking up the ball to elegant three-point backward, it is somewhat unreasonable.<br>This is the so-called rhythm and feeling. After the first three-point hit, Curie will probably burst into a burst at a later stage, so that the opponent can not be caught off guard. Within a minute, Curie will get eight points, just three rounds of things.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/08/The pioneer's defense is a crime, and all the gaps in Kuri's rise are opportunities/528cf811112d42088b4e59105713f9ce.jpg" alt="The pioneer&#39;s defense is a crime, and all the gaps in Kuri&#39;s rise are opportunities"><br>​</p>
<h1 id="The-pioneer’s-defense-against-disassembly-is-a-crime"><a href="#The-pioneer’s-defense-against-disassembly-is-a-crime" class="headerlink" title="The pioneer’s defense against disassembly is a crime."></a>The pioneer’s defense against disassembly is a crime.</h1><p>In fact, the Blazers’own defensive strategy is obviously problematic, because Curie can shoot three points with such ease and ease.<br>Can you imagine that the pioneers will bet the game on the three points of the Kuri or half-space? When Curie was able to shoot through the sky with his super-gods, the pioneers did choose a way to test Curie by “I throw you, you have the ability to throw me to death”.<br>Or did Kuri’s last series of three-point shooting against the Rockets give the Blazers an illusion?<br>Anyway, the chance came to Curie. Stephen Curie, one of the best opportunists in the league, did not hesitate to score 9 points in the playoff record of his playoff career. He beat the trailblazers like a falling flower.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/08/The pioneer's defense is a crime, and all the gaps in Kuri's rise are opportunities/f489b3ed892142f2a4e0465c2411887e.jpg" alt="The pioneer&#39;s defense is a crime, and all the gaps in Kuri&#39;s rise are opportunities"><br>​<br>This is Stephen Curie! It has gradually been recognized by everyone as the first three-point shooter in history, the three-point record holder in the regular season and the three-point record holder in the playoffs.<br>Even in the intense playoffs, Curie’s three-point shooting rate remained steady at more than 40% throughout his career. However, the pioneer gambled on his hit rate, a decision that was even somewhat ironic.<br>Of course, maybe you can also feel their helplessness from interviewing Coach Stotts after the game.<br>After the game, reporters asked Stotts why they did not choose to double Curie like other teams before.<br>“I don’t remember clearly. He scored 33 points in the second half of the game, did he? It was the Rockets that dumped him and then he scored 33 points in the second half, right? (Slater replies: Yes) That’s OK. We’ll think about it.”<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/08/The pioneer's defense is a crime, and all the gaps in Kuri's rise are opportunities/8ec4528bd60b458b8a077dba29458007.jpg" alt="The pioneer&#39;s defense is a crime, and all the gaps in Kuri&#39;s rise are opportunities"><br>​<br>In the face of the rocket’s extremely targeted dump, Curie can score 33 points at half-time. The Blazers’defensive resources are of course slightly inferior to those of the Rockets.<br>If you don’t choose to change defense, Kuri shoots Capella in the last game, plays Tucker and shakes hands three points, and shoots the basket after playing against Hacles in this game, and Baifo throws the super high board outside the three-point line into the inside line, all of which are the end of the defense depot.<br>And it’s a Curie with a finger injury.<br>So the pioneers dare not even expose the slow-moving Cantor to the library, which will be thrown into the brilliant collection of Curie’s career like Gobel in 2017.<br>So, it seems that there is no other way to limit Curie except to shoot in Curie and try to make the defenders play with a slight limit on interference.<br>But, really give Kuri a lot of good opportunities, Kuri is fully capable of doing the field to you into 8-9 three-point men.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/08/The pioneer's defense is a crime, and all the gaps in Kuri's rise are opportunities/9a36bc07db7b43419496dd6ea8e5313c.jpg" alt="The pioneer&#39;s defense is a crime, and all the gaps in Kuri&#39;s rise are opportunities"><br>​</p>
<h1 id="Finding-a-sense-in-Curie-is-the-most-dangerous-situation-in-the-alliance"><a href="#Finding-a-sense-in-Curie-is-the-most-dangerous-situation-in-the-alliance" class="headerlink" title="Finding a sense in Curie is the most dangerous situation in the alliance."></a>Finding a sense in Curie is the most dangerous situation in the alliance.</h1><p>This is the power of Kuri. None of the other three-point shooters in the league can achieve the same output and quality that Curie maintains on the three-point line.<br>When Curie finds the feeling beyond the three-point line, the great fear that gives his opponent and the many low-level defensive omissions caused by his opponent’s defensive system will completely collapse the defensive team’s system.<br>Popularly speaking, it’s what fans like to hear. It’s gravitational.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/08/The pioneer's defense is a crime, and all the gaps in Kuri's rise are opportunities/74bcf570a961437bbfa60a3c6d102e96.jpg" alt="The pioneer&#39;s defense is a crime, and all the gaps in Kuri&#39;s rise are opportunities"><br>​<br>Today, not only is Kuri’s singles three points, holding the ball to block three-point arrows like rain, the second half was forced to put defensive attention on Kuri’s more pioneers, but also Kuri’s gravitational scourge.<br>In the second half of the game, and more than once Kuri’s ball-less position directly attracted the attention of the Blazers 2-3 defensive players, and then Luni or a brother directly cut into the inside line to receive Green’s pass and dunk directly.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/08/The pioneer's defense is a crime, and all the gaps in Kuri's rise are opportunities/0bb05b3e04694308962a4c3f7b581832.jpg" alt="The pioneer&#39;s defense is a crime, and all the gaps in Kuri&#39;s rise are opportunities"><br>​<br>This happens repeatedly even in the last 4-5 minutes of the game. At a time when the pioneers need to catch up, the goal is a huge blow to their confidence and enthusiasm.<br>And when they changed their defensive position again, Curie got another chance to get a half-space on the right side through one-stop, three points in the middle.<br>“How do you play it?” This kind of mentality not only appears on the field, sometimes you can also feel this kind of mentality from the body language of NBA players.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/08/The pioneer's defense is a crime, and all the gaps in Kuri's rise are opportunities/70fd7160913c476582955249fc66c663.jpg" alt="The pioneer&#39;s defense is a crime, and all the gaps in Kuri&#39;s rise are opportunities"><br>​<br>It must be the most dangerous situation in the league and the least desirable situation for all warriors. Curie may only need one or two balls to get into shape, and any defensive gap he sees after that, even if it’s just a 0.5 second slip, could lead to three-point bombardment one after another.<br>Fans have seen this situation many times in the regular season, and it can happen in the playoffs, which shows that the pioneers are really in big trouble.</p>

Do you remember Beverly’s remark? Let’s first recall.<br>“I don’t think anyone would have expected to play Game 5 or Game 6. People didn’t even expect us to be in the playoffs. We want to make some noise. If the warriors really win the championship in the end, you know they have gone through the experience of the Clippers.<br>That’s what Clipper guard Beverly said when the Clippers lost to the Warriors in the Clippers Series. If the warriors really win the championship in the end, you know they have gone through the experience of the Clippers.<br>In fact, the Clippers’experience of the Warriors, or the battle between the two sides, is decisive for the Warriors’ playoff journey in the future.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/07/The problem of the warriors appeared in the first round, and Durant's injuries were a harbinger of the end of the dynasty/76948c564265480c838ae931d0138ec7.jpg" alt="The problem of the warriors appeared in the first round, and Durant&#39;s injuries were a harbinger of the end of the dynasty"><br>​<br>No one thought the Clippers would win the series when they first played the eighth Clippers in the West. In fact, the Warriors did pass, but the way the Warriors passed was so awkward.<br>In the first round of the playoffs, the Warriors started with five stars at home. Even though Cosins struggled in the first playoff game of his life and eventually got six fouls and left, even though Beverly’s close fight led to Durant and his pairs being expelled, the Warriors still won the game without any danger.<br>In the third quarter of the G2, the Warriors led to 31 points, but in the first quarter of the G2, Cousins’injury, Kury’s foul trouble, and the Warriors’ carelessness, they sent the players on the bench at the end of the third quarter to practice, which eventually led to a dramatic reversal of 31 points.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/07/The problem of the warriors appeared in the first round, and Durant's injuries were a harbinger of the end of the dynasty/a5664a7674454f37a24744856ab627a4.jpg" alt="The problem of the warriors appeared in the first round, and Durant&#39;s injuries were a harbinger of the end of the dynasty"><br>​<br>This dramatic reversal nailed the Warriors to the pillar of humiliation, and they woke up in time from the dream of three consecutive championships. Serious warriors are naturally beyond the Clippers’control. They have won two away games in Los Angeles in succession.<br>But back at home in G5, a rare full-court playoff game this year, which was blown up by opponents on the offensive side, the Warriors have Durant, have dreams, have Igodara, but they can not prevent opponents, Luwe and Harrel’s blockade upset the Warriors’defense area chickens and dogs.<br>In that series, the Clippers conquered the Warriors’two home courts, which is unthinkable. Oracle Stadium is about to retire this year. The Warriors’ bad attitude and their loose defense make Oracle and Warriors fans very embarrassed.<br>More importantly, the series may have been the trigger for Durant’s injury.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/07/The problem of the warriors appeared in the first round, and Durant's injuries were a harbinger of the end of the dynasty/d65c71410bb247abbfdf16e489390566.jpg" alt="The problem of the warriors appeared in the first round, and Durant&#39;s injuries were a harbinger of the end of the dynasty"><br>​</p>

In the sixth game, Durant slashed 50 points, but Curie and Clay suffered ankle sprains in the game.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/07/The problem of the warriors appeared in the first round, and Durant's injuries were a harbinger of the end of the dynasty/d342ef3bd5764c7ebfa376a4bff7abc4.jpg" alt="The problem of the warriors appeared in the first round, and Durant&#39;s injuries were a harbinger of the end of the dynasty"><br>​<br>Then the Golden State Warriors took on their biggest rival in two years, the Houston Rockets.<br>In this series, two teams fought from beginning to end in each game, and the highest score difference in each of the six matches was not more than 6 points, which is enough to prove the tragic nature of this series.<br>The Warriors started the series with their injured sparkling brothers, which meant that the team relied more heavily on Kevin Durant in the face of strong opponents.<br>What’s more, the Rockets’own style is for the Warriors.

He thought he had stepped on someone’s foot, but he didn’t.

Cooley, who had been depressed for a long time, finally saved his life in the G5. In the second half of the G6 match, he slashed 33 points to save the storm and put the Warriors on the stage of the Western Conference finals.<br>In the West Final, the Warriors played against the Portland Trailblazers, who were equally defeated.<br>Trailblazers are reimbursed by power center Nurkich before the playoff season begins. With their excellent double-shot performance, they will go all the way back and win Thunder and Nuggets to the West.<br>But the Warriors may be one of the most knowledgeable teams to open up the Pioneers. The Shuihua Brothers have obvious advantages in the face of double-shot, and the Warriors’front line gives more support to the team.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/07/The problem of the warriors appeared in the first round, and Durant's injuries were a harbinger of the end of the dynasty/e9fcd5a945e249adb0d681eb7cce1281.jpg" alt="The problem of the warriors appeared in the first round, and Durant&#39;s injuries were a harbinger of the end of the dynasty"><br>​<br>In the series against Trail Blazers, the Warriors lost more time than they won, but every time the Warriors’Jedi counterattack, they even the score instantly and even exceeded the score. Winning conceals too many problems.<br>In fact, the most lethal problem of the Warriors this year is defense, which has been exposed in the long regular season of the Warriors. In the past few years, the defensive efficiency of the Warriors in the regular season ranked in the top ten of the league, and in good times ranked in the top five of the league. But this year, defensive problems have become the direct cause of the Warriors’repeated collapses.<br>Defense problems also make the Warriors lose when facing the league’s strong teams. It is no longer the style of the league’s strong teams a few years ago. Even in the face of the rotten tank team, the Warriors also lost a big score or even suffered a terrible defeat at the home court. This is really a problem.<br>Kuri’s high level of play, the warriors’counter-attack to the pioneers of the Western Decision finally swept the end, and the pioneers’ defense in fact did not create any trouble for the warriors, 4-0 sweep brings the confidence of the players is also full.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/07/The problem of the warriors appeared in the first round, and Durant's injuries were a harbinger of the end of the dynasty/3cbca995822e402c94c9cab45d37772d.jpg" alt="The problem of the warriors appeared in the first round, and Durant&#39;s injuries were a harbinger of the end of the dynasty"><br>​<br>Only in the face of this season’s top defensive Raptors, playoff defensive efficiency League second Raptors, the Warriors in the Finals stage to eat the punishment.<br>The five positions of the Raptors’individual defense and coordinated defense echoes belong to the top of the league. Lorry’s offensive fouls, Danny Green’s soldier stickers, DPOY’s small cards and Siakam’s height and arm length, as well as DPOY’s small additions, these five people’s first defensive ability can be called explosive watch.<br>When the Warriors came up against the Raptors of this level, their attacks were blocked continuously. So far, they have played their best wave in the G2 in four matches, but after the G2, even the Warriors were dominated by the Raptors after the third quarter.<br>Today’s G4 game, the Raptors are in Oracle Stadium, in the Warriors’favorite third quarter of the anti-tourists as the main force, and eventually lay the winning game.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/07/The problem of the warriors appeared in the first round, and Durant's injuries were a harbinger of the end of the dynasty/1fbce3991ec04247a71b597bcc4a0d00.jpg" alt="The problem of the warriors appeared in the first round, and Durant&#39;s injuries were a harbinger of the end of the dynasty"><br>​<br>Speaking of it, without the excessive consumption of the first round, without the previous downturn of Clarkuri, there would be no excessive consumption of Durant, and if Durant was not injured, the warriors would not at least fall into such a desperate situation as they are now.<br>The experience of the Clipper Fleet, as Beverly put it, has not yet alerted the warriors thoroughly, but the pressure and consumption that the Clipper Fleet exerted on the Warriors may be the last straw for the Warrior Dynasty to end the crushing of camels.</p>

    <title>The seventh ranking of Kuri in 2009 was chosen. Where are the six people in Super Kuri now One man has become super giant</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/09/The seventh ranking of Kuri in 2009 was chosen. Where are the six people in Super Kuri now One man has become super giant/12c7b687450643538be2c7e13558cf24.jpg" alt="The seventh ranking of Kuri in 2009 was chosen. Where are the six people in Super Kuri now One man has become super giant"><br>​<br>Stephen Curry is naturally the hottest player in the League today. His three points and the trend of small balls sweeping the League based on his three points have had a great impact on the league’s basketball today.<br>Curie has also grown from the “Glass Man” who first entered the League to the first point guard in the League today, and is also the winner of two MVPs and three championships. Even if he ends his career with his current honor, Curie is qualified to hit the top of the history guard list.<br>But we also know that although Curie made a sensation in the United States during his college years, the “Mad Trip” in 2008 made Curie’s name famous for the first time in the country. At that time, Curie did not enter the NBA. But when he really came to the NBA and came to the draft convention, Kury didn’t get too much favor, or he didn’t get enough attention to match his fame in college. At the draft convention, Kury was chosen in the 7th place.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/09/The seventh ranking of Kuri in 2009 was chosen. Where are the six people in Super Kuri now One man has become super giant/46c092cd705943c8903d154546305da5.jpg" alt="The seventh ranking of Kuri in 2009 was chosen. Where are the six people in Super Kuri now One man has become super giant"><br>​<br>In fact, the situation of the six players before Curie at the 2009 draft was quite different. Some have become MVP players, able to sit on a par with Curie, and others have disappeared from the league. Let’s see.<br>The sixth-ranking player in 2009 was Timberwolves’guard Johnny Flynn, the fifth-ranking player, and Timberwolves’ guard Ricky Rubio. This is interesting. Timberwolves chose defenders in two consecutive rankings before Curie, but did not consider Curie.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/09/The seventh ranking of Kuri in 2009 was chosen. Where are the six people in Super Kuri now One man has become super giant/4fa8e4d1013e4511aae4d729219fc9de.jpg" alt="The seventh ranking of Kuri in 2009 was chosen. Where are the six people in Super Kuri now One man has become super giant"><br>​<br>In fact, Flynn was regarded as instant power by Timberwolves. Flynn averaged 13.5 points and 4.4 assists in the rookie season. He did well in theory, but his shooting percentage was low and his efficiency was low. Only one season later, he was traded by Timberwolves and disappeared quickly in the league.<br>The Timberwolves have more hope for a younger and more promising Rubio, who did not enter the League until the 2011-12 season, but in his first season, Rubio showed great possession and organizational talent, averaging 10.6 points, 4.2 rebounds and 8.2 assists. However, what troubled Rubio’s whole career was his shooting problems, which led him to be abandoned by the Timberwolves, and the same outcome was repeated by the Jazz.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/09/The seventh ranking of Kuri in 2009 was chosen. Where are the six people in Super Kuri now One man has become super giant/b0291a2c65e741c5929fad47397b1453.jpg" alt="The seventh ranking of Kuri in 2009 was chosen. Where are the six people in Super Kuri now One man has become super giant"><br>​<br>Fourth place Evans, rookie season is also able to match the existence of God, he is the fourth rookie season in the history of the League to play 20 + 5 + 5 players, the previous three, respectively, O, Jordan and James.<br>Such a starting point means that Evans has an unlimited future, but the King’s confusion and the team’s confusion about Evans’positioning make Evans seem to have embarked on the “injury Zhongyong” road, and now it is because the drug incident has been banned by the League directly, even the idea of playing in China. For now, he looks forward to playing in the future. The possibility of returning to the alliance will continue to decline.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/09/The seventh ranking of Kuri in 2009 was chosen. Where are the six people in Super Kuri now One man has become super giant/5b623c1e7c9d40aebb4b6348e08d0d34.jpg" alt="The seventh ranking of Kuri in 2009 was chosen. Where are the six people in Super Kuri now One man has become super giant"><br>​<br>Thirdly, Harden, the first point guard in the League today, grew from a substitute in the Thunder era to a scoring machine with an average of 36.1 points per game last season. Although he failed to break through in the playoffs, his current position is enough to be equal to Curie.<br>The second highest ranking in 2009 was Grizzlies’Hashem Tabbit, an unknown top scorer who scored an average of 3.1 points a season in rookie season. No wonder it has long been forgotten. Historically, there have been a lot of players who have had problems signing at the top of the list. At least in 2009, the water level has been particularly high.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/09/The seventh ranking of Kuri in 2009 was chosen. Where are the six people in Super Kuri now One man has become super giant/ef17b7ffe15d45218928910f67e5862f.jpg" alt="The seventh ranking of Kuri in 2009 was chosen. Where are the six people in Super Kuri now One man has become super giant"><br>​<br>The champion of 2009 belongs to Griffin. Although Griffin was injured for one year, he rose rapidly in the 10-11 rookie season and in the following years. Violent dunking became his symbol.<br>But the Clippers’time did not help Griffin to become a better player, but was traded to the Pistons, Griffin’s mentality finally changed, this year’s playoffs with injuries, it seems that people see a different Griffin.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/09/The seventh ranking of Kuri in 2009 was chosen. Where are the six people in Super Kuri now One man has become super giant/b3a456b6ce9c4330be8af3cf468c6de5.jpg" alt="The seventh ranking of Kuri in 2009 was chosen. Where are the six people in Super Kuri now One man has become super giant"><br>​<br>Who could have imagined that the 7th ranking, light-skinned and even unlike the black Curie, could grow into the first point guard in the League today, and the first point guard and the first point guard were released in the 09th session. Even if rearranged, Curie and Harden would definitely occupy the top two positions.</p>

    <title>The Lakers second team is saved! 18 minutes, 9 points, 3 boards, 1 assists, he&#39;s much better than pop</title>
    <url>/2019/11/03/The%20Lakers%20second%20team%20is%20saved!%2018%20minutes,%209%20points,%203%20boards,%201%20assists,%20he&#39;s%20much%20better%20than%20pop/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>So far in the season, the Lakers have exposed a very important problem. No one has been able to solve it in the past four games. I saw a little hope in the fifth game, that is, the Lakers’ second lineup lacks an organizational attack point, a holding attack point or a second scoring point other than a thick eyebrow.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/03/The Lakers second team is saved! 18 minutes, 9 points, 3 boards, 1 assists, he's much better than pop/156449831d764047845edc2963c31d97.jpg" alt="The Lakers second team is saved! 18 minutes, 9 points, 3 boards, 1 assists, he&#39;s much better than pop"><br>The problem will gradually improve from game 5.<br>In the game between the Lakers and the lone ranger, Kuzma, who was called the “third core” of the team by coach Vogel, made his first comeback. He played for 18 minutes, 3 of 8 shots, 4 of 3 points, 0 of 4 shots, got 9 points, 3 rebounds and 1 assists, with a positive and negative value of - 6. His performance was average, even a little bad. But because the Lakers won the game, no one went to investigate Kuzma’s performance It has to be good or bad.<br>Since the world cup injury, Kuzma has not played for a long time, the data is not good, the performance of the game is not good enough, so it can not be concluded. He needs a period of time to adapt to the intensity of the game and his teammates. After Kuzma returns, he will play with bushmei to lead the second team. When James leads the team, there are more changes on the field. When the bushy eyebrows lead the team, what kind of position should Kuzma take to partner with him? It requires Kuzma to use at least five games to find feelings and appropriate positions.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/03/The Lakers second team is saved! 18 minutes, 9 points, 3 boards, 1 assists, he's much better than pop/13e7b1d2d97c47ada171fdcc612ed6d5.jpg" alt="The Lakers second team is saved! 18 minutes, 9 points, 3 boards, 1 assists, he&#39;s much better than pop"><br>In order to see in the game, how does Kuzma’s return help the Lakers?<br>It may be a bit far fetched to say that he is a shooting point, because his ability of shooting outside the three-point line is “very stable”, 30% last season. In this game, he can only be said to be able to shoot in four shots, but you have to say how good he is, there is no evidence at all, and his ability to create projection outside the three-point line is not as good as pop and cook.<br>Kuzma mainly plays without the ball. In the game, when the bushbrow is in the low back single, when other players are holding the ball, Kuzma’s free cutting at this time is very effective, which can drive the defense and create the chance of layup. If a good chemical reaction is established between Kuzma and his teammates, this kind of free cutting will be a regular game for the Lakers in the second team Surgery. He does have a set of running and cutting, and the finishing ability is good. One of the three goals in the first show is that he received a pass from his team-mates at the low post.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/03/The Lakers second team is saved! 18 minutes, 9 points, 3 boards, 1 assists, he's much better than pop/ec4e19ac962444b6b06625d0ee71ed34.jpg" alt="The Lakers second team is saved! 18 minutes, 9 points, 3 boards, 1 assists, he&#39;s much better than pop"><br>Why Kuzma is so optimistic about Vogel? It’s mainly because he is very talented on the offensive side. His holding ability is effective, but his non ball ability is much better than pop’s. Kuzma’s catching and jumping ability is excellent, catching and hitting the basket is excellent, and under the basket finishing ability is excellent, so if you want to choose one of BOPP and Kuzma to play tactics, Kuzma is much better than BOPP. With the help of Howard’s cover, the Lakers can circle from the low post to the top of the arc, catch the ball and shoot and hit the basket. These are all tactics that the Lakers can’t play before Kuzma returns. After Kuzma returns, the Lakers’ tactical flexibility will be greatly enhanced. Maybe Rondo is still needed to organize the game, but compared with the first four games, the attack end of the second team of the Lakers will be greatly improved.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/03/The Lakers second team is saved! 18 minutes, 9 points, 3 boards, 1 assists, he's much better than pop/be7a40e9ccc242b59690eefa4feccecd.jpg" alt="The Lakers second team is saved! 18 minutes, 9 points, 3 boards, 1 assists, he&#39;s much better than pop"><br>It can also be seen from the first show that Kuzma’s return has a greater impact on the three people in the team.<br>The first one is Dudley. He didn’t get the playing time in this game. Originally, the average playing time was only 8 minutes. Now after Kuzma came back, the Lakers have position 4. With projection, Dudley’s defense is not very good, so he basically won’t get the chance.<br>The second and third are Mackey and Howard. McGrady played only 11 minutes in this game. As a starting center, it seems only nominal now. Because McGrady’s defense is not very good, so he is always replaced by Howard. In the regular rotation time of this game, the time that Howard should have played was when Vogel went to Kuzma. At the same time, he let bushmei play No. 5. Howard played every game The time was already more than 20 points. Because of the height of the lone ranger, Vogel made an exception and let Howard play the last 12 minutes and the extra time game of 5 minutes, which was only 26 minutes in total.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/11/03/The Lakers second team is saved! 18 minutes, 9 points, 3 boards, 1 assists, he's much better than pop/0d56b586beca46ef98a49cf4faf09209.jpg" alt="The Lakers second team is saved! 18 minutes, 9 points, 3 boards, 1 assists, he&#39;s much better than pop"><br>So if it’s a regular rotation, Howard’s time should be less than 20 minutes. The rest of the time is for the thick eyebrows to hit the center and Kuzma to play position 4. Now the Lakers have basically confirmed the rotation mode. No matter if there is rondo or not, bushmei must lead the second team. If there is no such main attack point, other teammates will go out without fear, and someone must hold down pop and cook. In this way, Kuzma and bushmei play at the same time, Howard’s time will be compressed.<br>If Kuzma’s defensive effectiveness improves, McGee and Howard will have less time to play.</p>

In that scene, the hearts of more than 20,000 spectators in Oracle Stadium were seized instantly.<br>The Warriors understand the importance of Kevin Durant to the team. His strong personal ability is the best breaker when the Warriors are in danger. And when the Rockets slow down the pace of the game and are about to pull the situation back, Durant hit the center of the stable army.<br>But after the mid-shot, Durant had no choice but to leave, and the Warriors soon learned that Durant could not return to the game.<br>The Warriors should be most grateful for Kuri’s recovery from G5 Durant’s departure. Curie’s 16 points in Durant’s 14 minutes were too crucial because it would be too difficult for the Warriors to keep suspense in the series if they lost the battle in Tianwangshan.<br>But even if the Warriors won the battle of Tianwangshan, without a superstar Durant who averaged 35 points per game, the Warriors became the underrated team.<br>Even though the Warriors are 3-2 ahead, on the one hand, the Warriors are going to Houston’s home court, and this series of warriors have not yet conquered Houston’s home court;<br>On the other hand, the Warriors can only adjust their rotation passively after lacking Durant. Before G6, the Warriors’bench can give little support to the team.<br>Everything is going in a bad direction, but the Warriors are fighting for a chance in that desperate quagmire.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/06/The situation of the Warriors today is somewhat similar to that before the Rocket G6, and the Warriors withstood the test/555eaecc9592432b9fe7b89ddf966202.jpg" alt="The situation of the Warriors today is somewhat similar to that before the Rocket G6, and the Warriors withstood the test"><br>​</p>
<h1 id="The-last-warrior-stood-the-test"><a href="#The-last-warrior-stood-the-test" class="headerlink" title="The last warrior stood the test"></a>The last warrior stood the test</h1><p>The Warriors withstood the test of desperation and finally beat the Houston Rockets to head up for the Western Conference finals.<br>“When KD is present, you still have some room for laziness. We just need to give him the ball and he can score. So he couldn’t play and we had to make adjustments, which was certainly a bit like going back to the past for us. Dream chase talked about the impact of the absence of KD on the team in an interview after the game.<br>It’s true that with Durant as a super-strong finish point to pass the ball and cooperate with the Warriors, Durant is accustomed to throwing difficult problems to Durant, and Durant’s personal abilities are fully within his grasp.<br>Over time, other Warriors will be inert and dependent on KD when they encounter difficulties, but with the overall strength of the Warriors, they can still use many ways to overcome difficulties.<br>But Durant’s absence has put all the warriors into a state of high tension, which may double the pressure on the players and imbalance the mentality, but the warriors who have experienced too many big scenes face the challenge directly.<br>In the G6 game, the Warriors really accomplished the life of the three armies, and Clay in the opening and the first half was like a killer possession. The Rockets certainly know that without Durant, Curie and Clay must be the focus of attention, but many of Clay’s first half goals were unreasonable goals that could not be created.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/06/The situation of the Warriors today is somewhat similar to that before the Rocket G6, and the Warriors withstood the test/4cc99b6271bc40198873823bd31d558e.jpg" alt="The situation of the Warriors today is somewhat similar to that before the Rocket G6, and the Warriors withstood the test"><br>​<br>Even though Curie suffered foul trouble in the first half, there were Jerebko’s rebounds, Livingston’s old man chatting about juvenile madness, Cook’s quick drop and three points, McKinney’s rebounds, dream chase series, one brother’s three points, Luni’s struggle, the Warriors insisted.<br>In the second half, Kuri recovered in time and failed to disappoint everyone. In the second half, Kuri scored a career-high 33 points, which ranked second in NBA history.<br>Even though finger injuries still afflict Curie’s nerves, at the most critical moment of the team, that sense of responsibility and mission has also been painful, overwhelming internal doubts, Curie’s outbreak has made the Warriors team into the strongest state.<br>In the fourth quarter, the Warriors made almost perfect decisions, each cooperation had a clear arrangement, and every goal was undisputed.<br>Kuri scored 23 points in the fourth quarter, including three points in cooperation with Dream Pursuit, three points in the face of Tucker’s tight defense, breakthroughs and throws in judging the situation, and eight penalties in the last minute, which completely stifled the Rockets’intention to fight back.<br>It must be said that even though the Warriors have played close to or even more than 100 games every year in the past few years, it is rare for the Warriors to show their overall Championship will in the semi-final against the Rockets after the outbreak of G6, which has been looked down upon by the whole world.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/06/The situation of the Warriors today is somewhat similar to that before the Rocket G6, and the Warriors withstood the test/d0d20abaf18940b495bf294396ea3674.jpg" alt="The situation of the Warriors today is somewhat similar to that before the Rocket G6, and the Warriors withstood the test"><br>​</p>

They still have the possibility to return home to win the series, but the Warriors themselves are very clear that the more backward the game is, the better for the Rockets, so their G6 thunderbolts won with their lives.<br>The G2 of the Finals is somewhat similar in nature. Even if the Warriors lose the next G2, they can still go back to home and defend the home court to equalize the series.<br>But the Warriors certainly don’t want to fall into this passive situation when their home advantage is lost, so the next G2 Warriors will still try their best to win.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/06/The situation of the Warriors today is somewhat similar to that before the Rocket G6, and the Warriors withstood the test/02b34f0978e94d2fafdbd95f791ec490.jpg" alt="The situation of the Warriors today is somewhat similar to that before the Rocket G6, and the Warriors withstood the test"><br>​<br>Curie also expressed his views on the team’s backwardness in the Finals after the game, saying: “Obviously we are very poor in 0-1, but this is not the end of the world. Along the way, we have new experience. We have proved our resilience and the ability to win the game. This game is a wake-up call for us. We will learn from such a night.<br>“The atmosphere in our dressing room was great and the opponents obviously played well, but our confidence remained unchanged. We’ll shield all the noise and try to get out and grab the G2, and then we’ll start.<br>“Anyway, we’re looking at the whole series. It’s been a long time. G2 is an opportunity for us to correct our mistakes. We’ll win it and go back to Auckland.”<br>The significance of this victory for the Warriors is also not small. The latest information about Durant’s injury is that Durant will probably return to G4 in the Finals, and the possibility of G3’s return is slight.<br>So if the Warriors G2 can win, they will create a better environment for Durant’s comeback, and once Durant fully recovers and plays, the Warriors’advantage will become infinite.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/06/The situation of the Warriors today is somewhat similar to that before the Rocket G6, and the Warriors withstood the test/ed909d77cb184eeda4b9a9d447ca6231.jpg" alt="The situation of the Warriors today is somewhat similar to that before the Rocket G6, and the Warriors withstood the test"><br>​<br>Whether it’s G6 in the Western Semi-Finals just past, G6 and G7 in the Western Finals last year, G3’s reversal in the 2016-17 Finals, or the lessons learned in the 2016 Finals, or the 1-2 backward Jedi counterattack in the 2014-15 Finals.<br>The Warriors have gone through too much in the past five years on the way to the finals.

    <title>The three major interiors snatched 32 rebounds, the interior won 30 points, and the Lakers exploded at a high speed</title>
    <url>/2019/10/06/The%20three%20major%20interiors%20snatched%2032%20rebounds,%20the%20interior%20won%2030%20points,%20and%20the%20Lakers%20exploded%20at%20a%20high%20speed/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The NBA preseason continues today, with the Warriors competing with the Lakers in the Chase Center of the New Stadium, and the result is that the game has been sidelined from the start. The Lakers started with a lot of energy. They didn’t give the Warriors any hope of winning. They finally won 123-101 to win the Warriors, and they made a good start in pre-season.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/06/The three major interiors snatched 32 rebounds, the interior won 30 points, and the Lakers exploded at a high speed/861cdada18d44adeb2cf4866e63be883.jpg" alt="The three major interiors snatched 32 rebounds, the interior won 30 points, and the Lakers exploded at a high speed"><br>This game is the first show of the Lakers’ Anthony Davies team. James came out as the starting partner. The result was that he only played for 18 minutes, and he contributed 16 points to 9 of the 16 shots. The data were omnipotent for 22 points, 10 rebounds and 2 assists. He played 12 minutes in the first match. In this section, he had a strong desire to attack, and the Lakers deliberately made a ball for the thick eyebrows. He made 7 of 11 shots in this season, and one of them dunked five times in the interior, which not only showed his good competitive condition, but also gave the Lakers an absolute lead in the opening.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/06/The three major interiors snatched 32 rebounds, the interior won 30 points, and the Lakers exploded at a high speed/31b19f3b1bbf4120801b9a88c4478648.jpg" alt="The three major interiors snatched 32 rebounds, the interior won 30 points, and the Lakers exploded at a high speed"><br>In the second quarter, the thick eyebrows continued to score 6 points. In this match, the thick eyebrows showed strong dribbling skills. In the face of defensive defense, he continued to get rid of the ball and then caused his opponent 2+1. The ball showed a strong ability to hold the ball. Although the 5 shot only hit 2 balls, the 5 points and 3 rebounds still reflected the thick eyebrows. Power.<br>Finally, less than half the time, the thick eyebrows gently played the positive and negative value of the +13, facing the warriors, which had no advantage inside the team, the thick eyebrows played exceptionally relaxed, although the outside 3 shots failed to hit, but it did not prevent the Lakers from winning.<br>In addition to the thick eyebrows, the Lakers’ core players also played a fairly enjoyable role. The playing time was 18 minutes. He got 10 points in 5 and got 15 points and sent 8 assists. Second of them scored 10 points and scored 6 free throws.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/06/The three major interiors snatched 32 rebounds, the interior won 30 points, and the Lakers exploded at a high speed/c5db42112c9c4ab38680aaa1719d97e5.jpg" alt="The three major interiors snatched 32 rebounds, the interior won 30 points, and the Lakers exploded at a high speed"><br>It is worth noting that the first half of the match was played for 10 minutes, but one point did not come out. In the second half, 8 minutes later, not only did he show his dunk, but also completed the relay in the air, and got 9 points in the half court, and finally he got 9 points and 9 rebounds in the match. In addition, he also took the initiative to fight the demolition and try to integrate into the team. As he said, he may sacrifice himself this season and then help the Lakers go further as a blue collar.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/06/The three major interiors snatched 32 rebounds, the interior won 30 points, and the Lakers exploded at a high speed/806d4166d82d4774a7beeb9c05299773.jpg" alt="The three major interiors snatched 32 rebounds, the interior won 30 points, and the Lakers exploded at a high speed"><br>Of course, the key to winning the Lakers is in the field. According to statistics, the Lakers’ thick eyebrows + Mcgee + Howard made up 3 rebounds, and there were 58 rebounds in the whole match, which were 11 more than 47 of the warriors 47. Correspondingly, the Lakers scored 30 points more in the interior than 66-36, and the second offensive scored 8 points more than the Warriors. These data all reflect that the Lakers used a high advantage to dominate the interior, while the Warriors’quick counter-attack did not show up in front of the Lakers at all.<br>In addition, the Lakers sent 32 assists in the match, the ball’s transformation was excellent, and the leader took 8 assists, while the whole substitute player sent up to 20 assists, whereas the warriors only had 20 assists, and the main control team sent only 1 assists. Here we can see that when the Lakers make the 1 place, the fluency of the offensive will be better and the score will be better.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/06/The three major interiors snatched 32 rebounds, the interior won 30 points, and the Lakers exploded at a high speed/42f5495579114e0ab33826125cd330e3.jpg" alt="The three major interiors snatched 32 rebounds, the interior won 30 points, and the Lakers exploded at a high speed"><br>It is worth noting that after the game, the Lakers will make a slight adjustment, and then fly to China to participate in the 10 NBA China race. And this thick eyebrow to the Lakers first show let us see the strength of the Lakers in the new season, in fact, Zhan eyebrow combination contribution 37 points and 13 rebounds data is even more than rivals. Of course, in the beginning of the new season, who encounters the Lakers such a combination, they should be difficult to take advantage of the interior.<br>In short, the Lakers showed us a very good state in this pre-season match. I believe that fans will have new expectations for the thick eyebrows and James when they come to China for the 2 pre-season match.</p>

In fact, the previous example is very prominent, that is, Cousins ​​before the injury. Cousins ​​entered the league in 2010 and initially played for the Kings, but failed to lead the playoffs in the next eight years.<br>Although Cousins’s personal ability is very strong, but he still has no stage to play in the playoffs, only 15 teams in 15 teams can enter the playoffs, under the strong flesh, this is also a very competitive thing. Not to mention that this is in the more competitive West.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/30/The total score of the history of the playoffs, the top is not Jordan The top five have four superstars from the Lakers/3bf385e7ec6d44aa90abbcb16b3c9068.jpg" alt="The total score of the history of the playoffs, the top is not Jordan The top five have four superstars from the Lakers"><br>​<br>Originally in the 2017-18 season, Cousins ​​could make a good start to the playoffs without any surprises, but he suffered a big injury from the Achilles tendon. After the injury, he was not so comfortable in the Warriors’ playoff game.<br>Cousins ​​is of course only a case. In fact, the stars do not say that they will enter the finals. The difficulty of entering the playoffs is not so great, but the ability to enter the playoffs for a long time is the absolute ability. The first test of the star standard is often the record, the star that can lead the team to victory, is the real superstar, and the victory usually means tickets for the playoffs.<br>Then, in the history of NBA, the overall ranking of the playoffs should be quite informative against the star’s color.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/30/The total score of the history of the playoffs, the top is not Jordan The top five have four superstars from the Lakers/ab14b52982ab43e3a518847561d207a6.jpg" alt="The total score of the history of the playoffs, the top is not Jordan The top five have four superstars from the Lakers"><br>​<br>We all know that Jordan is probably the most dazzling star in NBA history, but in fact the first place in the NBA playoff history total score is not Jordan, Jordan has been surpassed by a person a few years ago, only The second person in history, and the one who surpassed, is LeBron James.<br>At the same time, James is also the only player in active service who can enter the top 10 in the history of the total score in the playoffs.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/30/The total score of the history of the playoffs, the top is not Jordan The top five have four superstars from the Lakers/03b946d98655446dbf1a882063fe6f16.jpg" alt="The total score of the history of the playoffs, the top is not Jordan The top five have four superstars from the Lakers"><br>​<br>As of now, James has scored 6911 points in the playoffs, ranking first in NBA history. He has surpassed the second place in Jordan by nearly 1,000 points. According to the development of the Lakers, James may still score in the playoffs. Continue to rise, after James retired, this total score in the playoffs will also become the most difficult to break in his record.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/30/The total score of the history of the playoffs, the top is not Jordan The top five have four superstars from the Lakers/6081907d35ff428f9d9989bed42a3194.jpg" alt="The total score of the history of the playoffs, the top is not Jordan The top five have four superstars from the Lakers"><br>​<br>Jordan, the second place, scored 5,987, but in fact, Jordan has a career of 15 years, except for the rookie season and the last two farewell seasons, he all entered the playoffs, then the first playoff after 33.4 points of history The average score is ranked second in the current total score of the playoffs.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/30/The total score of the history of the playoffs, the top is not Jordan The top five have four superstars from the Lakers/31685c90e3b04882bb7ef4d1a9f11f6c.jpg" alt="The total score of the history of the playoffs, the top is not Jordan The top five have four superstars from the Lakers"><br>​<br>The third place is Jabbar’s 5762 points. Kareem is also a 20-year-old great god. His regular-season total score is also the highest in history, and the third place in the playoffs is not unusual.<br>The fourth place is Kobe Bryant, with a total score of 5,640 points. Kobe Bryant’s 220 playoff games are also the sixth in history, averaging 10th in scoring history, but taking into account Kobe’s pre-career role and career. Late injury, maybe he can do better!<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/30/The total score of the history of the playoffs, the top is not Jordan The top five have four superstars from the Lakers/e1b9ec52887d4894a1f3a3404f7d0a60.jpg" alt="The total score of the history of the playoffs, the top is not Jordan The top five have four superstars from the Lakers"><br>​<br>The fifth place is O’Neill, who got a total of 5,250 points. Kobe still has to press his old rival and old friend on this matter. This is an interesting thing;<br>In the sixth place, Duncan, 5172 points, Duncan’s existence is the absolute dependence of the Spurs. For more than 20 years, Ivy has stacked Duncan into this position.<br>The seventh place is Karl Malone, the “Innocent King” scored a total of 4761 points in the playoffs, the eighth is “Logo” male 4457 points, the ninth is also from the Spurs’ GDP portfolio, Tony Parker, a total of Take 4045 points.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/30/The total score of the history of the playoffs, the top is not Jordan The top five have four superstars from the Lakers/4772962f73664cbe9c006bc30527b28d.jpg" alt="The total score of the history of the playoffs, the top is not Jordan The top five have four superstars from the Lakers"><br>​<br>Another star in active service who entered the top ten is Durant. In fact, “Death” is only 2 points away from Parker. Waiting for Durant to return from injury, he wants to raise his ranking by one liter. It is not difficult.</p>

The Clipper’s super toughness enabled them to win God’s favor and complete this miraculous reversal.<br>They are a group of respectable players. They are a more respectable group.<br>Difficult, the way to defeat the Golden State Warriors is to let the defending champion hold the lead first, then relax, and finally work hard to reverse the victory?<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/02/The way to defeat the Warriors is to let the warriors relax before reversing the victory/eda27170f47b45b9bb269db74a27dbbe.jpg" alt="The way to defeat the Warriors is to let the warriors relax before reversing the victory"><br>​</p>

The third quarter just came up and hit a wave of current, directly pulling the difference to 31 points. But Kuri committed two fouls in the first quarter, got the third foul in the second quarter, and soon got the fourth foul in the third quarter.<br>But for protective reasons, Cole took Curie off the court directly. Most importantly, at the end of the third quarter, when the Clippers continued to cut off the momentum, Cole did not choose to take back the team’s most stable holding point and the biggest threat from the outside Kuri.<br>It was only in the last attack at the end of the third quarter that Cole chose to put Curie and Durant on the court for the final attack at the same time.<br>After a long rest in Curie, the first half of the hot feeling of cold. The Clippers were not confident enough to shoot after the break-up, but it was a mistake in passing, and the Clippers also got 2 points against the whistle.<br>At the end of the third quarter, the Clippers had only 14 points left behind the Warriors, which was already a dangerous difference.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/02/The way to defeat the Warriors is to let the warriors relax before reversing the victory/6a9026be1fea4f6380477214cd7afb77.jpg" alt="The way to defeat the Warriors is to let the warriors relax before reversing the victory"><br>​</p>
<h1 id="Rotation-is-the-biggest-weakness-but-the-Warriors-did-not-intentionally-cover-it-up"><a href="#Rotation-is-the-biggest-weakness-but-the-Warriors-did-not-intentionally-cover-it-up" class="headerlink" title="Rotation is the biggest weakness, but the Warriors did not intentionally cover it up."></a>Rotation is the biggest weakness, but the Warriors did not intentionally cover it up.</h1><p>The Warriors’reserve line-up this year is the weakest in recent years, which I have stated many times. But in the playoffs, Cole still hasn’t made any adjustments to cover up this weakness.<br>As I have mentioned before, the weakness of the rotation team is that because of the wealthy configuration of the Warriors’team, Cole can completely split several of the Warriors’ stars and use them in pairs to help the Warriors transition.<br>By contrast, the Clippers have the strongest reserve team in the league. Louis and Harrell not only have strong scoring ability in their respective positions, but also their block and tear-up is the end of the Clippers’killing tactics.<br>In the phase of rotation, the Warriors’non-starting line-up has no way to block and disassemble Luwe and Harrel, basically allowing the group to score frantically.<br>In today’s game, there are many situations in which Curie and Durant are not present at the same time. Clay’s role at the offensive end of the series was almost minimal because of the crazy chase and tearing of Clippers.<br>So if Curie and Durant are not present at the same time, and Cosins is injured and left, the shortcomings of the Warriors’presence can be said to be infinitely magnified.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/02/The way to defeat the Warriors is to let the warriors relax before reversing the victory/8efda1c219e44e08a0284557128550ff.jpg" alt="The way to defeat the Warriors is to let the warriors relax before reversing the victory"><br>​<br>For example, with 2 minutes left in the third quarter, when Lowe’s 2+1 was only 16 points left, Durant was replaced. The line-up was Green, Cook, Brother One, Luni and McKinney, which lasted one round and Cole replaced Clay. But when Clay was put on guard, it still didn’t make much difference.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/02/The way to defeat the Warriors is to let the warriors relax before reversing the victory/01edc68e4e6c490c962fd7f99321a354.jpg" alt="The way to defeat the Warriors is to let the warriors relax before reversing the victory"><br>​</p>

The Warriors lost their first home game in the playoffs in 2014, and the last time the Warriors lost their first home game to the Clippers.<br>Of course, the Clippers of that time and the Clippers of today are human beings. But the Clippers’resilience has always been there, and the players’ efforts and perseverance have never been lost.<br>Even if we look back at the first game, the Warriors are only a dozen points ahead in the last four minutes or so, and the Warriors’starting line-up does not rest until about two minutes are completely locked in.<br>But in today’s game, when the Clippers started, the Warriors were not only unable to respond, Cole did not call a timeout to make adjustments. The Warriors’team and even the fans may have thought that if they were so much ahead, they could still lose to you.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/02/The way to defeat the Warriors is to let the warriors relax before reversing the victory/c214c69b201a489db52ba31d31ce38d7.jpg" alt="The way to defeat the Warriors is to let the warriors relax before reversing the victory"><br>​<br>Beverly’s pressure on Durant disappeared because of Beverly’s six fouls, but Durant had already committed five fouls to cover up the six fouls.<br>The most trustworthy Durant at the critical moment went down, after a long rest, Kuri came up and lost all four shots, Clay’s key arc top three points were slightly off, so the Warriors have gone.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/02/The way to defeat the Warriors is to let the warriors relax before reversing the victory/338c2224c1df47bfacf1ece3cbab9d70.jpg" alt="The way to defeat the Warriors is to let the warriors relax before reversing the victory"><br>​<br>The Clippers can accomplish this miraculous reversal, which is of course worthy of respect. They are incredibly resilient. Of course, we have to say that if the Warriors stay focused, the Clippers will be as breathless as they were in the first half.<br>This hard-won victory is a heartbreaking stimulus for all the Clippers, and failure is also a heavy blow and warning for the scattered Golden State Warriors.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/08/02/The way to defeat the Warriors is to let the warriors relax before reversing the victory/8b66d45b756142d68313923d7c4f7d79.jpg" alt="The way to defeat the Warriors is to let the warriors relax before reversing the victory"><br>​<br>The Warriors must realize that all the opponents in the playoff arena deserve to be valued and respected, and that winning every game requires hard work.<br>This amazing reversal only represents the beginning of the series.</p>

    <title>Three shots of iron! Bedsley was criticized by Paul for not passing the ball to you unless he continued to play</title>
    <url>/2019/10/14/Three%20shots%20of%20iron!%20Bedsley%20was%20criticized%20by%20Paul%20for%20not%20passing%20the%20ball%20to%20you%20unless%20he%20continued%20to%20play/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Chris Paul’s performance was amazing in the Thunder’s pre-season victory over New Zealand’s saboteurs. But it’s not the data, it’s the spirit he sacrificed for the team. Because Paul only made four shots in the game and got six points, three rebounds and four assists.<br>Although the data is not very gorgeous, Paul is undoubtedly the temptation to score for the Thunder. Paul was suppressed by a team last season. After arriving at the Thunder, many fans also hope that Paul can increase the number of shots, at least in the face of the Thunder is Paul as the team leader.<br>He could do it as many times as he wanted, but Paul became a traditional point guard and a mentor of the team.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Three shots of iron! Bedsley was criticized by Paul for not passing the ball to you unless he continued to play/c85a1959e7a74e16a9108cbd0ead32ab.jpg" alt="Three shots of iron! Bedsley was criticized by Paul for not passing the ball to you unless he continued to play"><br>Paul is responsible for linking up the team, not fighting for the right of young players. And tactically, Paul prefers to put himself in the position of team mentor. So Thunder played real team basketball, Adams opened two pairs of models. Alexander, the future cornerstone, also cut 19 points.<br>Diallo also got the ball, scoring 16 points. It can be said that Paul acted to show that he could be seamlessly traded to Thunder. He did not delay the development of young people, he did not rob Alexander of the ball.<br>No matter which team you go to, you can help your team get into the playoffs in your own way. Because Paul is activating his teammates and making them stronger.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Three shots of iron! Bedsley was criticized by Paul for not passing the ball to you unless he continued to play/d94fce8ff9a04a43a80e50f206b96cff.jpg" alt="Three shots of iron! Bedsley was criticized by Paul for not passing the ball to you unless he continued to play"><br>This is Paul’s own superstar influence and what Thunder wants to see. Some stars have gorgeous statistics but can’t lead the team into the playoffs, and Paul can. And when it comes to saboteurs, Paul is like a real leader. When the Thunder was 32 points ahead, Paul was still pulling rookie Darius Bedsley to guide him.<br>Paul stood behind Bedsley on the sidelines and gave him some guidance. Paul also revealed what he said to Bedsley today.<br>Paul mainly showed him some experience of the course, such as how to get vacancies and set up cover, and showed him the importance of angle.<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Three shots of iron! Bedsley was criticized by Paul for not passing the ball to you unless he continued to play/db18a06f73de403d86a35b91f399a9b2.jpg" alt="Three shots of iron! Bedsley was criticized by Paul for not passing the ball to you unless he continued to play"><br>In addition, Bedsley was warned by Paul that there was a round in which Paul communicated with Bedsley. The main reason is that Bedsley gave up a three-point shot on the fourth time after losing all three of his three-point shots.<br>Paul was very dissatisfied with that. He told Bedsley that if you don’t have the confidence to shoot three points, then I can tell you that I won’t pass you any more.<br>Paul said: “ I told Bedsley that I think you can put it in. If I think you don’t have confidence in shooting, I won’t pass the ball to you!<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Three shots of iron! Bedsley was criticized by Paul for not passing the ball to you unless he continued to play/8eb4c09ff72542a4ab8c02456b58b27f.jpg" alt="Three shots of iron! Bedsley was criticized by Paul for not passing the ball to you unless he continued to play"><br>After hearing this, Besley’s eyes are no longer confused but full of self-confidence, because the boss will pay attention to you on the court. And he doesn’t care if you can shoot, or if you can hit. Paul just wants these players not to hesitate when they start.<br>This is Paul’s own alternative way of leading the team. He always gives you encouragement and support. Most of Alexander was very convinced of Paul, and today he talks about breaking the bad guys.<br>Alexander also apologized publicly: “I like Chris Paul’s leadership, but I don’t like the way I started. I was a bit slow and rash to break the bad guys in the first half!<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/10/14/Three shots of iron! Bedsley was criticized by Paul for not passing the ball to you unless he continued to play/1f81f786ec4c4c9295e6a1a63703e741.jpg" alt="Three shots of iron! Bedsley was criticized by Paul for not passing the ball to you unless he continued to play"><br>As Van Gundy, the Pre-Magic coach, said on the show, the Thunder is still effective. Van Gundy believes that if the Thunder players are healthy, their lineup is not weak at all. They have Paul + Alexander + Adams + Robertson + Gallinari starting five tigers, backup and Schroeder, in the West can fight.</p>

    <title>Thunder VS pioneer G3 Three days is doomed, seven points rely on hard work, prestigious Jedi survival</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/17/Thunder VS pioneer G3 Three days is doomed, seven points rely on hard work, prestigious Jedi survival/32564c2387c24cecb625feeab4ee3377.jpg" alt="Thunder VS pioneer G3 Three days is doomed, seven points rely on hard work, prestigious Jedi survival"><br>​</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-home-advantage"><a href="#What-is-the-home-advantage" class="headerlink" title="What is the home advantage?"></a>What is the home advantage?</h1><p>The Blazers and Thunder series are now back in Oklahoma, home to the Thunder. In the NBA, there is a saying that has been circulating for a long time, the series began to win away.<br>Even with a 2-0 lead, if the Blazers don’t win at home, the series will continue to drag on.<br>After returning to Thunder’s home court, the Thunder team’s performance has changed dramatically from the previous two games. The most subjective point is that in the first two games, the Thunder made a total of three-point shots, making 10 of 61 shots, with a shooting percentage of only 16.4%.<br>In this game, the Thunder team shot 15 of 29 shots from the three-point line, and the shooting percentage was close to 50%. This difference is quite huge.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/17/Thunder VS pioneer G3 Three days is doomed, seven points rely on hard work, prestigious Jedi survival/454ebbe5d1ae4c6a8aad26cec497519a.jpg" alt="Thunder VS pioneer G3 Three days is doomed, seven points rely on hard work, prestigious Jedi survival"><br>​<br>Why is it that returning to the home Thunder team is like changing a team? Even Weishao’s depressed hand feel has ushered in an outbreak.<br>In the home game, the pressure of role players will be well shouldered by the fans on the spot. When players score goals, the cheers of fans on the spot will give them more confidence. This is the so-called home advantage.<br>Character players will play better at home, which is very important for the home team.<br>Players like Weishao, his goal and the release of his emotions after his goal, as well as his interaction as team leader and fans on the spot, all of these will stimulate the spirit of the whole team.<br>Although this spirit can not be touched and quantified, its function is real.<br>The so-called momentum represents morale and power in competitive sports.<br>If the team is united and powerful, it will be ambitious and vigorous, like the wind, like the thunder, and overwhelm the enemy, which is called momentum.<br>Especially in the 0-2 backwardness, has retreated the irreversible stall, the Thunder team died and then came into being.<br>Pressure at this time, because the home fans cheer and strong support has been removed a lot, without too heavy pressure, players can more freely play their original strength.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/17/Thunder VS pioneer G3 Three days is doomed, seven points rely on hard work, prestigious Jedi survival/a23a59a6c1864386b29314c4154ebac4.jpg" alt="Thunder VS pioneer G3 Three days is doomed, seven points rely on hard work, prestigious Jedi survival"><br>​<br>For example, the first two games were Grant 8-1 and 7-2, respectively. Today, 4-5 shots from the three-point line continued the much-needed firepower for the Thunder team. For example, Ferguson, who made 3-3 shots from 9-3 in the first two games, also made 3-4 shots from outside the three-point line today, and still made three fouls in the first quarter of the game. The young players withstood it. Pressure helps the team.<br>And today’s Schroeder, according to the body of Schroeder, as long as he plays in the playoffs, he will definitely be the target of opponents, but today, Schroeder not only played a good defensive performance, but also showed his value in the offensive side.<br>In the fourth quarter, he helped the Thunder to survive the most dangerous period of time by making blocked mid-shots and killing. Schroeder scored 17 points in 5 of 11. In addition, he also had 5 rebounds, 6 assists and 2 steals, which showed amazing performance.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/17/Thunder VS pioneer G3 Three days is doomed, seven points rely on hard work, prestigious Jedi survival/083befa846804a4f8b6833c9f6e62b2c.jpg" alt="Thunder VS pioneer G3 Three days is doomed, seven points rely on hard work, prestigious Jedi survival"><br>​</p>
<h1 id="Few-Jedi-survive"><a href="#Few-Jedi-survive" class="headerlink" title="Few Jedi survive"></a>Few Jedi survive</h1><p>The role players are divided by three points, and the Thunder team needs the core players to show their authority. Otherwise, only George, who made three of 16 shots in this game, the Thunder’s game situation is quite dangerous.<br>In this vital game, Westbrook came out. Weishao’s feeling is basically a barometer of the Thunder Team.<br>In the first half of the match, the thunder and the pioneers were in a stalemate. Here we have to mention Thunder’s double-shot defense in this game.<br>With the strength of two shots, of course, it is impossible to be completely restricted by the defense, but the Thunder started well.<br>They asked George and Grant to play against Lillard or CJ McCollem, respectively. After the opening of the game, several shots of the two guns were out of line, which played a role.<br>In addition, Thunder’s response to the pioneers’previous attempts to block and disassemble attacks was to let the defending double-gun players directly bypass the cover, instead of simply exposing the slow-moving Adams to the skilled double-gun.<br>Thunderstorm can keep the situation in check until the shooter’s rhythm is suppressed at the beginning.<br>At the beginning of the third quarter, the Thunder Team began to rise, relying on the play of both the Thunder and the Less Thunder.<br>Weishao assisted George’s 3+1, followed by Weishao’s super bloodcap against Lillard, as well as Weishao’s back singles Lillard 2+1 and the subsequent cradle Baby action, these scores and emotional release let the Chesapeake Energy Stadium fully activated.<br>This is the beginning of the thunderstorm. When momentum rose, Thunder immediately held a lead of about 10 points.<br>In the fourth quarter, Weishao’s several surprising three-point long shots were the final conclusion of the game.<br>Strangely enough, the pioneers in the first two matches who completely let go of the three points are choosing to go forward and take precautions today. On the contrary, after being put on defense, the three-point power loss seems to have found the sight, and the more the shot, the more accurate it is.<br>And when Wilson’s three-point sense of touch returns, his threat of attack returns.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/17/Thunder VS pioneer G3 Three days is doomed, seven points rely on hard work, prestigious Jedi survival/f9b16a8d30d8415d87e18b8438214773.jpg" alt="Thunder VS pioneer G3 Three days is doomed, seven points rely on hard work, prestigious Jedi survival"><br>​</p>
<h1 id="CJ-which-still-feels-good-and-Lillard-which-goes-all-the-way-to-the-extreme"><a href="#CJ-which-still-feels-good-and-Lillard-which-goes-all-the-way-to-the-extreme" class="headerlink" title="CJ, which still feels good, and Lillard, which goes all the way to the extreme."></a>CJ, which still feels good, and Lillard, which goes all the way to the extreme.</h1><p>Two guns are the core of the pioneers. Even on Thunder’s away ground, they are still not disappointing. The Blazers’weakness in this game is still above the so-called role players.<br>On the road, the support given by the role players to the core players is significantly reduced. But CJ is stable enough, smart enough, and Lillard is horizontal enough.<br>CJ’s defense against George or Grant in this game has a fairly normal feel, but his smartest thing is to know when to shoot.<br>CJ catches up with the Thunder Team during the link-up period, and steals three points from the Thunder Team’s defensive foot. The effect is quite good.<br>The third quarter of Lillard, as if killing God, if not for the third quarter of the Thunder outside three-point feel also maintained at a fairly high level, the Thunder team may be the third quarter of a 25-point Lillard alone.<br>The third section in the rhythm of Lillard, whether it is the three-point break-up, or the strong layup after crossing the folder, basically not lost, one person supported the attack of the whole team. At the same time, it can also cause great defensive attraction while striving for easy scoring opportunities for teammates, which is the strength of super point guard.<br>Of course, it was Lillard who broke his rhythm in the fourth quarter that failed to continue the fire. On the other side, Mayor was in high spirits, and the game was over.<br>​<br><img src="http://www.gouyaotuan.xyz/2019/07/17/Thunder VS pioneer G3 Three days is doomed, seven points rely on hard work, prestigious Jedi survival/2fc06ee7aa054645bccfdc180a0c48ff.jpg" alt="Thunder VS pioneer G3 Three days is doomed, seven points rely on hard work, prestigious Jedi survival"><br>​<br>Now the Thunder home court pulls back a city, the big score is 1-2, the Thunder is still passive, they still have to guard their home court.<br>And the most interesting thing is that in these matches, Lillard and Wilson have been completely confronted, and the resentment between the two naturally need not be mentioned in the past, who are not satisfied with anyone, the stadium is also the main killer.<br>So this series, from the point of view of the fans, of course, the more you play, the better.</p>
