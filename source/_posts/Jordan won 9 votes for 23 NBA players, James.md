There are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people's eyes. Shakespeare's famous saying is that there are a thousand Hamlet in a thousand people's hearts. It means that people with different opinions and wisdom have different opinions. A thousand people will have a thousand or more ideas about the same thing in their minds.
The same example applies in the field of basketball, and the most frequently used place is the vertex PK in the field of basketball, such as who is the most historic in the field of basketball?
In most people's minds, the history of basketball is not even a problem, because Michael Jordan's name is almost linked to basketball. The most obvious example is a person who may not know basketball at all, but he probably has heard of Michael Jordan's reputation, which is Jordan's unique position in the field of basketball.

But in fact, from the basketball player's point of view, as the world's top group of basketball players, let them be willing to admit the greatness of others, it is not an easy thing, especially the players who have achieved great achievements in the NBA.
Recently, American media have made a statistics and integration, in the eyes of 23 NBA historical celebrities, who is the best Goat in the NBA?
First of all, the results are interesting. In the minds of 8-9% of the public, Jordan firmly occupies the best place in history. He only got 10 votes in full reckoning, which may be a more surprising result.
The final result is Jordan's 10 votes, of course, Jordan's votes are ahead of the others by a large margin, the status of detachment is still revealed;

​
Jabbar, the top scorer in NBA history, won 4 votes. Of course, Jabbar's career is more than "Sky hook". Six regular season MVPs, five champions, two FMVPs are solid honors.
Chamberlain, who got three votes, can be called the "basketball emperor" this kind of overbearing nickname player, naturally has two brushes, and Chamberlain left behind a series of almost unbreakable records, which highlights his historical status;
LeBron James was younger than the gods on the list, but he still got two votes. There were old hooligan Jordan, Chamberlain and James in the record book.

​
In addition, Russell, the Lord of the Rings, got one vote, Oscar Robertson, the Big O, and Lemon, who most probably never heard of, got one, but it was from Chamberlain.
It was Jabbar who chose Big O, and Bob Pettit, a Hall of Fame member, who chose Russell.
There were Oscar and Isaiah Thomas voting for James.
The three votes for Chamberlain were Pippen, Rick Barry and Ferrezer. Of course, Pippen's vote was relatively far-fetched.
For Jabbar, Marlon, Dr. J, Bill Wharton and George Gwen, the Iceman.

​
Jordan's 10 votes were solid, mostly from his opponents, such as Bird, Magician, Barrick, Elgin Baylor, Bob Cusey, O'Neill, Olajuwon, and the ancient LOGO man Jerry West and Lady Russell.
Of course, when it comes to statistics, the media acquiesce in Jordan's own choices. After all, Jordan has never answered this question positively, but it shows something that he does not admit that others have the best history.

As the article begins, a thousand people have a thousand Hamlet in their hearts, let alone in the eyes of these haughty athletes.
Without confidence in themselves, they may not be at the top of the NBA pyramid, and they certainly have the right to remain so arrogant.
However, we can't expect them to really cross time and space in the same stadium to win and lose. This kind of confrontation is just like "Guan Gong and Qin Qiong". It's reasonable for a fair mother-in-law to say she's right.

However, Jordan's historical position is not exaggerated. From the hard indicators of superstars, the accumulation of six Championships + 5 MVP + 6 FMVPs has made him grow from the talented player who just started his career to the greatest one in history. This is not evaluated by others, but the achievement of Jordan's birth.
