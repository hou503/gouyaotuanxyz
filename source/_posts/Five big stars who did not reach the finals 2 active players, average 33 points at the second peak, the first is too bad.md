​
In the 70 years of NBA history, there are too many players who failed to win a championship ring and retired, full of regret. Even those who won the championship, were selected for a while and even got MVP, there are many players who did not win the championship, even those who did not reach the finals.
Among the stars who have not been to the finals, the first few are all famous figures. Cameron Anthony, who has no ball to play, is one of the hot topics in recent years.

​
The best result of Anthony's career in the playoffs was the Western Finals, the 2008-2009 Western Finals, where Anthony's leading Nuggets met Kobe Bryant's Lakers.
In that series, Anthony did well. He averaged 27.5 points, 4.8 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game, but what he met was a really mature Kobe Bryant and the complete Lakers. Kobe Bryant averaged 34 points, 5.8 rebounds and 5.8 assists per game, even 2.2 errors per game were better than Anthony's 2.8. Such Kobe Bryant, such a "king of the West" performance, can only let Anthony defeat.
But I didn't think that since then, Anthony's treatment in his late career has gone from bad to worse. Kobe Bryant has retired tours, and Anthony's retired tours even need to be a topic of debate. It's a bit of a shame to be discussed about the past.

​
Donnie Mick Wilkins seems to be somewhat similar to Anthony's situation. Wilkins, who is the essence of human movie, is actually a super scorer. He has 24.8 points in his career and thirteenth place in NBA history. But the best shooting guard of his generation is Michael Jordan.
In fact, Wilkins was not very lucky. His playoff opponents were either the Celtics in the 1980s, the two consecutive championships in the late 1980s and even the Pistons that blocked Jordan out of the Finals, and then Jordan, which made Wilkins not even go east in his entire career. In the final, he stopped the Eastern Semi-Finals four times, which really means "how can you make your life bright?"

​
In fact, in addition to Anthony, there is another star who has not yet touched the finals, Chris Paul.
Paul's career is full of honors, but it is this "Western Decision" that has become Paul's life enemy. Before arriving at the Rockets, Paul's journey to the Western Conference was rough and arduous. The closest one, in the playoffs of 2015, Paul defeated the defending champion Spurs in the first round, but was dramatically reversed by the Rockets'1-3 lag in the second round, which basically laid the end of the breakup of the Clippers. 。

​
After arriving at the Rockets, Paul finally had a taste of the Western Conference finals, but in the good situation of the original team, his injury changed the balance of the series, and finally stopped one step away from the Finals, never returned to the same height.
Now Paul has been sent to the Thunder and it's incredibly difficult to get back to the Finals.

​
One of the stars whose career regrets have not reached the finals is "Iceman" George Gwen, who scored four times and five times in a while. Only those of James or Durant who can compete with this honor in active service have scored 26.2 points in the career field, ranking 10th in NBA history. At the peak of his career, Gwen is also able to compete. A monster scorer with an average of 33 points, but playoff Gwen was also reversed by a 3-1 lead in the Eastern Finals and failed to reach the Finals.
The most unfortunate superstar who has not reached the finals is Nash who won MVP twice. Nash won MVP both in the Sun and in two successive MVPs. Nash explained the definition of MVP with the Sun, which had won only 29 games in the previous season, and 62 wins in just one season.

​
But such Nash, in the playoffs is a little sad, his career into the Western Finals four times, but four times are regrettable defeat, but in fact, Nash's latest time from the Finals may not be four times, but the 2006-07 season of the Western Semi-Finals.

​
In the semi-finals, G4 Horry viciously crashed into Nash, triggering a conflict between the two sides, the Suns will be banned, which may be the strongest form of the Suns team, so helpless out. Whether it's the Mavericks'decision in the early days of his career or the Lakers' attempt to chase the championship at the end of his career, Nash has not been able to go any further. It's a pity for the basketball guard who is smart enough to be a good point guard.
