In fact, the 36 person team is not weak, the two sides played very well, but by the end of the first quarter, the Jazz scored 12-0 points in a wave of 12-0, the breakthrough in Jeff Green, the three points in the middle distance, and the new jazz support system was almost the tactical system for the seamlessly butting the team, and this summer has been in the whirlpool of the trade, scoring 7 points in 5. Negative + 30 responds to the team's final choice. Even without three top players, the Jazz now has nine players to rotate, which is terrible!

But Reggie Miller put forward different opinions. Of course, the Clippers and the Lakers are obvious, but the Jazz are still a dynamic team. Like the Clippers, the overall strength is balanced and there is no obvious weakness. They also added a number of outside shooters in the summer, such as Green, Bogdan and Bradley, who have outside shooting ability. So in Reggie Miller's mind, the top eight places in the West are Nuggets, Clippers, Jazz, Lakers, Trailblazers, Warriors and Rangers.

No matter which rankings, they want to get into the top eight in the brutal West. It is very difficult. In the past two years, the Jazz have fallen to the same team for the two time because of the lack of support from the side, but the jazz of the new season is definitely worth looking forward to. Today, we can see the Lakers' game. It took 18 minutes to finish the game. The clipper debut is on the way. The cruel West is starting to compete, but don't neglect the Jazz coming back.
