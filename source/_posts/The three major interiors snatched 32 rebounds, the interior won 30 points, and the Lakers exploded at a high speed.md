Correspondingly, the Lakers scored 30 points more in the interior than 66-36, and the second offensive scored 8 points more than the Warriors. These data all reflect that the Lakers used a high advantage to dominate the interior, while the Warriors'quick counter-attack did not show up in front of the Lakers at all.

It is worth noting that after the game, the Lakers will make a slight adjustment, and then fly to China to participate in the 10 NBA China race. And this thick eyebrow to the Lakers first show let us see the strength of the Lakers in the new season, in fact, Zhan eyebrow combination contribution 37 points and 13 rebounds data is even more than rivals. Of course, in the beginning of the new season, who encounters the Lakers such a combination, they should be difficult to take advantage of the interior.
