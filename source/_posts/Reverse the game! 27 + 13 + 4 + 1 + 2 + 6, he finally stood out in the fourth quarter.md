Trailblazers challenge clippers away. The last clipper lost to bucks, Leonard was questioned by the outside media and reporters because of his rotation. This game was announced, the lineup is relatively complete, and the overall strength will be greatly increased. The Blazers lost to the warriors in the last game, which is a disgrace to a strong western team. Therefore, the Blazers management attached great importance to the game and came to the scene to watch.

In the first quarter of the game, Lillard started with a 3 + 1 score of 4 points, and Hu De also made three-point shots from the outside, but this didn't let the Blazers play the attack wave of the outside, because the first three goals of the Blazers were all obtained through the middle and long-distance projection, and the breakthrough of the inside line was either to play iron or to be robbed. The defense strength of the front line and the inside line of the Clippers was very strong, which didn't give the Blazers a chance. At the same time, zubates grabbed three rebounds in the front court. The Clippers didn't play very well at the offensive end, but they played very actively. From the preparation of the game, the clippers were better.
In the rotation phase, the Clippers changed to Harrell and Ludwig, and the trailblazers left Lillard on the field. Luwei relies on his strong scoring ability to score continuously by making fouls and flying jump shots, but Lillard is not so easy to score. The clippers have a strong defense on Lillard, trying to force him out of the ball. Two under the basket breakthrough shots can't be scored, once by the blood cap, once by the interference, once by the cover and also by the snatch. Leonard came back in the last minute to play two attacks but didn't touch the ball. In the first quarter, both sides played 26-22, and the Blazers were 4 points behind.

In the next quarter, Leonard brought Harrell and Luwei on the court, while the trailblazer's backup team only had a slightly stronger scoring point like hood, which was originally the opportunity for the clippers, but Leonard made two mistakes in the opening game, and it took three minutes to open the score to 8 points. McCollam was the first to return to the field, but the pioneer's attack did not improve much, the difference between the two sides remained at 5 points, and fell into the iron fight.
Throughout the second quarter of the game, the attack rhythm of the two teams was a bit stagnant, there were too many fouls and many mistakes. Relying on zubates's hard work and positive defensive attitude under the basket, the Clippers almost blew up Whiteside, who led the team to score. In the last three minutes, the Blazers worked hard to score several goals. At the end of half-time, the two sides were 40-47, and the Blazers were 7 points behind. For the two attacking teams, the score was a little ugly.

In the third quarter of the game, Leonard's condition was still not found. The substitute took a rest off the court with two guns, relying on zubates to stabilize the rhythm at both ends of the attack and defense. Mccullham opened up in the first half of the game. Although he didn't score three points, he scored two very stable points. After playing half a game, he scored 12 points, equalizing the score.
After the Clippers replaced Leonard and zubates, there was no height in the inner line. Lillard made several consecutive attacks on the inner line, and the difference was quickly surpassed by the Blazers to 6 points, and Luwei and Harrell were unable to control the scene on the court. At the end of the three quarters, the Blazers and Clippers played 76-70.
At the end of the game, Leonard came up and scored two goals in the free throw line, but he still didn't make the shot outside the three-point line, and the state was not fully opened. Relying on Luwei and the breakthrough score, the clipper kept approaching the score. But the pioneer side strange soldier has played the role, the young general Simmons has scored four goals in a row, has scored 10 points to stabilize the difference.

The clipper's whole game's outside line hit rate is very bad, Leonard and Luwei can't throw in, so Leonard increased the impact of the inside line in the last five minutes, was sandwiched and gave the ball to Harrell, the effect is good, once the score to 1 point. In the last three minutes, Leonard and Luwei hit three goals in a row near the free throw line through the play and pick tactics. Then they turned to Beverly to defend Lillard and forced him out. The clipper pulled the difference to four points by the three-point shot of attack and defense conversion and Luwei, which basically killed the game.
At the end of the game, the two sides played 101-107. Leonard made 9 of 23 shots, 27 points, 13 rebounds, 4 assists, 1 steals, 2 blocks and 6 mistakes. Leonard played very badly in the first three quarters, made a lot of mistakes, and hit a low percentage. In the whole game, he shot 0-for-5 in three-point shots. In the fourth quarter, he worked hard and helped the Clippers to score points through the mid-range jump shot. In the last quarter, he played 12 minutes, got 18 points, 6 rebounds and 1 assists, with a positive and negative value of + 12 in a single quarter. Of course, the key goal to win the game in the end is the three-point shooting from the outside line of Ludwig against the defense. Ludwig is still the "father" of the Clippers.

On the pioneer's side, Lillard and McCollam also made 9 of 23 shots, and they also got 22 points. They also didn't open their hands on the three-point ball. McCollam made 1 of 6 three-point shots, and Lillard made 3 of 10 three-point shots. It can be said that whoever scored three points in the final moment of the game will win the game. Luwei did it and the Blazers failed to do it.
