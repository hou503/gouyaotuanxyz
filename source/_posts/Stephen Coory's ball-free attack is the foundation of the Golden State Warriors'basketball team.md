# Curie's Ballless Running
Let's take the Western Final just finished, the Warriors against Trail Blazers at the end of the G4 first quarter, Stephen Curry's classic free-kick run as an example.
In the previous defensive rounds, the Warriors successfully defended the Blazers'attack, and Luni got the front rebound, Luni got the front rebound, 24 seconds has begun to count. Luni then handed the ball to Livingston, who then handed it to Curie to push it forward.

​
Curie then pushed forward, facing his younger brother Seth-Curie on the right. A simple change did not get rid of Seth, who was familiar with his habits. He turned and protruded from the left into the interior. He saw the empty Livingston and wanted to send a concealed pass to Livingston to attack the basket directly.

​
But this intention was spotted by Hood in front of Curie, who intercepted the downward pass in the air.
But Kuri, who is quick with eye problems and hands, will soon get the uncontrolled ball back into his hand and run to the bottom left corner. At this time, Hood and Kouri directly formed a replacement. Curie had the ability to shoot three quick shots at the bottom left corner, and Hood dared not jump out.

​
This opportunity was fleeting, and Curie did not force it. He did not choose to project but continued to break through when the Hood Center was too far ahead.

​
During the run, Curie handed the ball directly to Luni, who was unattended at the top of the arc. This is certainly not an opportunity for Luni to shoot three points, but a Give and go. Curie tries to get a three-point shot by running with the help of teammates.
In the course of running to the right side of the court, the rookie Jacob Evans's analysis of Curie's tactical intentions is obviously not enough. He didn't help Curie to block the following Curie for the first time, so Luni didn't choose to pass the ball.

​
But then Kouri and Lillard completed the defense change again, and Luni taught Green the ball.
If Lillard does not concentrate on his back, a rhythm shift in Curie may be able to throw Lillard away and then follow up with a dream pass to shoot three points at the bottom corner, but even if Lillard turns his back on Green, he still concentrates all his attention on Curie.

​
So instead of trapping himself in the bottom corner, he dribbled the ball to the top of the arc.
From the beginning of dribbing the ball to the top of the arc, Curie realized that it would also be a three-point tactic designed for him. Although Dream-chasing handed the ball to Jacob Evans for a transition, it was still for a better catch at the top of the arc.

​
And Curie has begun to act. Left Livingston and Luni were supposed to set up double gear at 45 degrees on the left, but Lillard slowed down for a moment, and Curie reached the top three points of the left arc with Livingston's single gear.

Green passed directly across.

​
Lillard, who slowed down a step, wanted to interfere, but couldn't keep up with it. He could only jump up the cover. After Kuri shakes Lillard off with a false move, he was confident to shoot in less than three seconds and hit three points!

​
So far, from the Warriors to rebound to advance to the front, Kuri's defender changed four times, Kuri ran two laps around the three-point line, and finally the Warriors patiently spent almost 24 seconds of offensive time to find the best opportunity, found the game feel quite good in the Kuri. Curie eventually hit three points with his knife in his hand.
In fact, the Warriors'line-up, other players have limited ability to attack independently, but they still rely on Kuri's ball-free and opponents play back and forth. The Warriors'other players, regardless of their positions or passing choices, handled them calmly and wisely.
As the core player of the Warriors, Curie is willing to surrender the right of the guard to his teammates, to run without the ball, or even to block and tear the ball to his teammates. This may be the place where the Warriors basketball team is really stronger than other teams.

# Kuri's lack of balls has brought the greatest benefits to the pursuit of dreams.
"He always trusted me and passed me the ball. Especially in this series, they wrapped him up and he gave me the ball and trusted my organization. Whether it's scoring or assisting teammates, he always trusts me, which we have since 2015. If he wants to shoot, no one blames him, but he passes the ball to me and gives me confidence.
This is the words after the G4 chasing dream, chasing dream oneself is very clear, his assistant data soaring and Kuri's assistant data all the way down is the corresponding.
During the 13-14 season, Curie averaged 8.5 assists per game, which ranked fifth in the league.
Since then, the 14-15 season in which the Warriors really began to rise, Curie's assists have continued to decline, from 7.7 in 14-15 season to 5.2 in 2018-19 season.

​
However, the number of dream-pursuing assists has increased from 3.7 assists in the 14-15 season to 7 in the last four years.
It was his amazing performance in the 2014-15 season that earned him the first big contract in his career. In the summer of 2015, Warriors and Dream Green entered into an early contract renewal contract worth $85 million in five years.
At that time, the first time to renew the contract, the dream chaser and his mother video fairy tale, dream chaser's mother cried bitterly.
This renewal contract can not be separated from the efforts of pursuing dreams, but Kuri's ball-free, Kuri's selflessness, Kuri's shared data and ball rights are the reasons for the real dream to get this heavy renewal contract.
So Dreamchase always pays tribute to Curie. He knows that Curie is the one who saved his career. "I'm a product of Curie," and "If Curie can't make you better, you're terrible." These words are all about the loyalty of dreams to Curie.

# Kouri without a ball, merging with Durant and the whole team
Durant's arrival has been questioned by the outside world. How do the two ball-holding players share the ball power and allocate the offense?
But Kuri's top ball-free league, Clay's top ball-free league, even Durant's ball-free ability is quite strong, coupled with dream-chasing series, the powerful Golden State Warriors almost never bothered by the allocation of ball rights.
However, Durant came to the Warriors after the increase in ball power is also true, Curie is not without complaints, but he did not because of personal problems affect the overall situation of the team championship.
In times of crisis, Curie can still come forward to save the team, such as after the Western Semi-Final G5 to carry the performance of the team.
But if Durant returns, for the sake of the team's integration, Curie may continue to work tirelessly to run without the ball, or sometimes get a single chance and fail to hit, but please don't question the ever undervalued superstar.
The semi-final G5 to the present six games average 30 +, the Western Finals is a series of games average 36.5 points, ranking second in the history of the Western Finals, these performances prove Curie's ability.

​
When he came to dominate the attack, the warriors were still unstoppable, but after Durant's return, the warriors still needed Curie's ball-free team to twist into a rope, so that the Golden State Warriors would be truly invincible.
