​
"I know what a competitive player he is, and I know we'll be a perfect match together. We talked about what to do next and how to achieve our goals step by step. Unfortunately, this opportunity will never come again."
After retirement, Bryant talked about his career, about his 20-year career in the Lakers, the most regrettable thing is that he did not mention Jordan in the public opinion, but mentioned such a person. He also said that, unfortunately, he never got the chance to work with him.

In fact, Kobe's career has been called a resounding one, with its peak, valley, injury, unruly youth, heroic loneliness in the middle of his career, maturity and evolution in the later stage, injury and self-struggle at the end of his career, and the final perfect curtain call.
Kobe Bryant's career began with O'Neill, one of the most dominant centers in history, who won three consecutive championships together.

Kobe Bryant's personal heroism reached its peak during his two consecutive scoring championships, but failed to help the team win. He knew he needed to change.
The Paul Gasol deal made Popovich very angry. Only the coach of this opponent could understand how it would improve him to give a teammate like Paul Gasol to the top Kobe Bryant. Unfortunately, the Lakers went three finals and won two championships in the next three years.

In 2012, the aging Lakers formed Howard, Nash, Gasol and Kobe's F4 combination, but it seems that every time the Lakers'F4 ended badly. In 2004, the final final of the F4 was bitter. In 12 years, the final of the F4 was Kobe's Achilles tendon rupture.
But among so many teammates, whether good or bad, whether they are in harmony with each other or in contradiction with each other, Kobe may not have some regrets. In his interview after retirement, Kobe himself talked about one thing of that year and the original possibility that he regretted not being able to work together in that year. Chris Paul, his teammate.

At that time, Paul was also the synonym of the first point guard in the league. Although Kobe was 33 years old at that time, his peak tail still entered the League for a while. No one dared to underestimate Kobe before he was injured.
Such a super backcourt combination would have been a foregone conclusion. After knowing the deal, Paul began to communicate with Kobe about what happened after they became teammates. Then the deal was intervened by the league and quickly rejected.
At that time, the Hornets were entrusted by the league, so there was no way to do anything about it. The deal that had already been finalized was still blown up. The combination of Kobe and Paul could only exist in people's imagination forever.

"Crazy, exciting," Paul told reporters after knowing the progress of the deal. "We talked about everything that might have been a teammate, and in the blink of an eye, the deal went off."
If this super-backcourt combination can be achieved, perhaps the Lakers'fate will not be as miserable as that after 2012, or even younger Paul to help Kobe relieve the pressure, Kobe may not have suffered that Achilles tendon injury.
"Everything will be very, very, very different," Bryant used three "very" in a row, "because we're probably the most aggressive people you've ever seen in the league."

They used to be Olympic teammates and have been paired up several times on the All-Star Game. They are both one of the most ambitious players in the league. They are both paranoid about winning.
In fact, in his later years, Paul and Harden have been able to compete with the top warriors, so that the Warriors have encountered the greatest crisis in recent years. Who can imagine the peak of Paul without injury attack, and with mature Kobe, what would be a wonderful scene?
