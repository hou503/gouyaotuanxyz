Since it's a back-to-back game, Poseidon chose to take a rest and dongqiqi would surely bear more attack pressure, which is also a test of dongqiqi's ability to lead the team alone. Grizzlies are not a strong team, and the main players are absent. Although the lone ranger lacks a strong attacking point, it is not difficult in theory to take a victory away from home.

In the first quarter of the game, Boban played the center of lone ranger, and their attack ability on the inside dropped a lot, so dongqiqi tried his best to create attack opportunities for his teammates on the outside through his toss after the pick and roll. In the beginning of the game, Kuri got a very good cell phone conference, and made three three three-point shots in a row, but grizzly bear's attack efficiency was also very high, The outside line is very accurate, the inside line is also very easy to play Boban, the difference has not been opened.
After Powell came up, he just increased the vitality of the inner line, not the efficiency of attack. After Powell received the pass, he could hardly handle the ball and wasted some good opportunities. In the second half of the game, both sides started to play iron mode, although the intensity of defense on the field is not big, but the player's hit rate is very low. At the end of the first quarter, the two sides finished 31-34, grizzlies led by 3 points, and Dongqi got 10 + 7 + 5 in a single quarter.

The second quarter of the game, the two sides came on the bench, also did not produce a better defensive performance, but the gap is out. Grizzlies don't have a good attack and organization. Under the leadership of Bronson, the lone ranger is very smooth in attack and has a high hit rate. In less than three minutes, he has a wave of 13-6, exceeding the difference. The lone ranger didn't change their attack and defense after he asked for a pause. The lone ranger substitute then played a wave. The inner line's passing and cutting cooperation, the outer line's chasing 3 + 1, and the instantaneous difference was 13 points. The game was less than half played, the two sides played 24-8, Dongqi has not yet played.
After the main players of both sides came back, dongqiqi played health basketball with the advantage of 10 points. Most of the rounds were organized and attacked by Kuri, and dongqiqi stood by watching. In the last minute of the game, dongqiqi wanted to hold the ball and play two, but he was defended by Claude and other Grizzlies. The lone ranger's attack was confused, and Grizzlies hit three counterattacks in a row, and all of them were successful. At the end of the second quarter, Grizzlies and lone Rangers finished 62-68. In addition to playing time and making a mistake, there was no increase in any other data.

In the third quarter of the game, dongqiqi strengthened his personal attack at the beginning. In the second quarter of the game, the rest time was too long. In more than two minutes, three of the four attack rounds were personal attack with the ball. Two goals were continuously thrown out of the three-point line. One player scored 8 points in a row and stopped playing Grizzlies. But after the pause, grizzlies scored three goals in a row, changed a 7-0 wave, and reduced the difference to 4 points again. The attack of lone ranger is very organized, but the three points of defense end, dongqiqi, Curie and Boban, are almost the level of loopholes.
After changing back to Powell, the overall mobility of lone ranger increased. Dongqiqi connected the team's attack in the second half of the game. However, his teammates played iron many times, and Kuri wasted many empty shot opportunities. Grizzlies also play very simple, almost in two conduction ball on the shot. At the end of the third quarter, the two sides played 104-91, with lone ranger leading by 13 points, while dongqiqi got 24 points, 14 rebounds and 8 assists, quasi triple double.

At the end of the game, the two sides started a fight against each other. The attack was very simple, because there was no defense on both sides, but the difference was always over 10 points, which was not friendly to Grizzlies. In the last five minutes of the game, under the leadership of Bronson, the lone ranger expanded the difference to 20 points. Dongqiqi was a back-to-back game. Although he missed two assists to play three pairs, there was no need to come back and brush the data.
In the whole game, the two sides played 138-122. Dongqiqi played 28 minutes, made 9 of 16 shots, 2 of 6 3-pointers, got 24 points, 14 rebounds, 8 assists, 2 steals, 2 mistakes, plus or minus 1. Among them, dongqiqi only played half a quarter in the second quarter of the game, angrily cutting 0 + 0 + 0, doubting that he was learning from James in rowing, but there is no evidence, if not rowing, it is estimated that he can cut three pairs in three quarters.

On the whole, it's easy for lone ranger to win this game. Grizzlies are not a strong team. They thought the defense would be better, but from the performance point of view, the defense is positive and bad. Lone ranger's advantage is built in the rotation time, and the second team easily builds the leading advantage. The Grizzlies have a lot of absentees. Jarun Jackson has a good performance, scoring 23 points. The rest of the players are mediocre.
