# Seth Curie with some brotherly light
Seth-Curie first joined the unknown University of Liberty. Speaking of the freshman season, Seth-Curie actually did quite well. He averaged 20.2 points, 4.4 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game. He was the top scorer among the freshmen in the United States. Seth-Curie also broke the freshmen in the Greater South by the way. Season scoring record.
But at that time, not many people knew the little guard who had only 1. 88 meters. He was even shorter than his brother Stephen Curry.
In fact, it was Stephen Cooley's March trip, which shocked the whole country in 2008, that made Stephen Cooley famous in the United States, and reminded Duke University, who had missed Stephen, of another Curry, Seth Cooley.

​
Old K coach of Duke University missed Stephen Cooley of course. They thought that thin Stephen Cooley could not stand the fierce competition of College basketball, but it turned out that Old K's wisdom sometimes mistook people.
Stephen Cooley averaged 21.5 points in a big game, and Davidson College, with its second-tier league, made a comeback on a crazy March trip, losing just one goal to Kansas University, the NCAA champion of the season.
In the third season, Stephen won the NCAA scoring championship, scoring 28.6 points, 4.4 rebounds, 5.6 assists and 2.5 steals per game.
In fact, the outbreak of my brother Stephen Cooley contributed to the transfer of Seth Cooley to Duke University after the 2008-09 season.
Seth grew up at Duke University. By the time he was a senior, he was already the center of the team's perimeter. He averaged 32.3 minutes per game, scored 17.5 points and 1.5 assists, and scored 43.8 percent of the three-point shooting.
Of course, according to common sense, physical fitness is general, height is not enough, only the projection ability of senior students Seth is naturally not favored by the NBA team.
What's more, Seth underwent surgery on his right tibia in 2013, and his injuries have become a hidden danger in his career.

​
At that time, the Golden State Warriors also gave Seth Curie a chance. At that time, the Golden State Warriors team in 2013 was already a team with Stephen Curie as its absolute core.
Seth, who lost the draft in 2013, signed a non-guaranteed contract before the Warriors, playing in the pre-season for the team, and growing up in the Warriors'Development League team, the Santa Cruz Warriors.
After that, Seth began a bumpy journey from Warriors to Grizzlies, then to Cavaliers, to Phoenix to sign a 10-day contract, and then the Sun did not choose to renew it.
Seth also played in the summer league for Pelicans in 2015. And then my brother Stephen Curie won another championship for the Warriors in the 40 years after the 74-75 season. The Golden State Warriors'Little Ball Storm swept the league.

# Seth Curie, who has been chasing him, is like today's robbery behind him.
Since then, Seth has been looking up at his brother Stephen Curie and working hard.
Before the start of the 2015-2016 season, Seth earned a base salary contract for the first time with his performance, and Kings and Seth signed a two-year, $2 million contract.
In his 44 games for King Sacramento in the 2015-16 season, Seth averaged only 15.8 minutes per game, 5.1 shots, and 6.8 points per game with a 45% three-point shooting percentage, which is a very good efficiency.
This performance naturally attracted the attention of other teams. Later in the season, Cess refused to execute the Kings'contract and became a free agent. He chose to sign for Dallas, where he played his best season in his career.
Average 29 minutes per game, 42 starts in 70 games, the three-point shooting rate is still 42.5% efficient, the highest career average of 12.8 points per game, in addition to 2.6 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.1 steals.
But in February, the season underwent surgery on the left leg and tibia, and the season was reimbursed, entering a long recovery period.
Injuries once again seem to cast a shadow on Cescu's future, but his excellent performance has given him great confidence in bringing in his team. The name of the Kuri family is also trustworthy.

​
Eventually, before the start of the 2018 season, the Blazers won Seth-Curie on a two-year contract, and Seth-Curie proved his health by playing a healthy season for the Blazers.
In these 74 matches, Cess basically played as the main substitute, averaging 18.9 minutes per game. The three-point shooting rate was still 45% efficient, averaging 6.3 total shots per game, 3.4 three-point shots and 7.9 points.
Seth Curie, who had a firm foothold among the pioneers of the Western Powerful Team, followed the stubborn Pioneers all the way to the front of his brother Stephen Curie.
"I want to live in the present. My previous goal was to get into the playoffs and experience the atmosphere of the playoffs. I had never played in the playoffs in my previous career. But now we have reached the Western Conference, although the opponents are warriors, we still look forward to challenging for the final seat. To tell you the truth, this year has been a bit fantastic for me. I am now in a Western Conference team and have a stable playing time. I really appreciate the excellent team like Blazers for giving me the chance. I have to cherish everything now and I will try my best to help the team move forward. That's what Seth Cooley said in an interview.

​
Just four years ago, he was still wandering in the league, wandering around for a contract. At that time, Seth watched his two-year-old brother roaring in the league. While he was happy for his brother, he thought that he would be sad, unwilling and regretful.
His goal at that time was only to get an NBA contract and recognition, but now he has entered the playoffs, he has an indispensable contribution in the team, he faces his brother, the strong defending champion, and strives for the chance to enter the finals.
In the first game, Cess was average, scoring 1 of 7 shots and scoring only 3 points. But Seth said, "It's normal, the shooter's state will fluctuate," just like his brother's tone.
So in the second game today, Ces-Curie played for 29 minutes. At the last critical moment, the coach still gave him great confidence. He stayed on the court until the last moment and hit a three-point point point that would bring victory to the team. He was firm and confident.

​
In 29 minutes, Seth made 5 of 9 shots, 4 of 3-point 7 shots, 16 points, 1 rebound, 2 assists and 4 steals. Even the four steals were taken from my brother Stephen.
One of the most classic snatches is Seth, who is blocked by a dream, catches up with his brother desperately behind him, and then snatches the ball from behind. The expression on Stephen Cooley's face was intriguing when the camera was given to Stephen after the robbery.
It was like Seth's pursuit of Stephen throughout his career. Even though he was blocked and torn apart by fate, he still accelerated to catch up with his brother from behind, to catch up with his brother on the stage of the Western Finals, and to face off with his brother in the presence of his parents and family.

# Brother doesn't have to shoot in response. He knows what better to do to win.
Of course, it was Stephen Cooley and his Golden State Warriors who won the game.
Seth Curie played his part, but Stephen Curie was still in charge of all the situations at the end of the game. Curie made only one mistake in the last half of the season when he was snatched from the front by Seth Curie.
For the rest of the time, Kuri's machine-like brain ran at high speed, looking for pioneer holes, and then spared no effort to attack.
Stephen did not respond to Seth Curie's three-point goal, but was always looking for the best chance for the team to win.
For example, he made concealed mid-shots, such as his layups through his brother's and Leonard's defenses, such as his killing assists to chase the Dream Sky Basketball.
Stephen took away the victory, but Seth can leave with absolute pride. He has demonstrated his ability on this supreme stage. His powerful three-point ability shows the horrible projection gene of the Curie family.

​
Maybe it's just an ordinary Western Final for Stephen Cooley, but Seth is standing in front of him after crossing mountains and rivers.

The game may be won or lost, but for the Kuri family who watched the match on the sidelines, there is absolutely no loser today.
