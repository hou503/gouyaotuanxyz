The 42-year-old old Carter once again won a contract extension from the Hawks, which means that the former "half-man" will begin his 22nd NBA season. Playing for 22 consecutive seasons is extremely rare in NBA history.
Not surprisingly, the old Carter's regular-season appearances will surpass Stockton and Nowitzki next season and rise to third place in NBA history. With the retirement of Nowitzki last season, Carter became the player with the most appearances among active NBA players with 1,481 appearances.

​
So what are the top ten players in active duty, except for Carter?
Ranked second is Jamal Crawford from the Suns, playing a total of 1,326 games. Last season, Crawford played a total of 64 games, averaging 7.9 points and 3.6 assists in 18.9 minutes per game. Crawford has not yet won an NBA contract, and although he has been in the league for 19 seasons, he is clearly able to make a significant contribution on the court.
The third place is Paul Gasol, who has just signed a one-year contract with the Trail Blazers. He has played 1226 games so far. Last season's Gasol played 30 games, averaging only 3.9 points and 4.6 rebounds. In the first half of the season, Gasol, who still played the heat in the Spurs, was traded to the Bucks and was not consistent with the team's style. There are not many opportunities to play. But as a veteran, his leadership ability is not to be underestimated, Gasol will be a powerful complement to the pioneers.

​
Next is the Lakers' LeBron James, who played 1,198 games. The years seem to have not left a trace on this historical superstar. Last season, James averaged 27 points, 8 rebounds and 8 assists per game, and his shooting percentage exceeded 50%.
Even though he has been in the league for 16 seasons, James still maintains the league's first-class standards with superb self-control and hard training, which is uncommon in NBA history.
In the new season, the Lakers signed Anthony Davis and other outstanding role players. James will once again attack the championship in his 17th season.

​
Ranked fifth is Kyle Korver from the Bucks, playing a total of 1,174 games. As one of the two remaining players in the league in 2003 (the other is James), Korver quickly gave the team an olive branch after becoming a free agent. He eventually chose to join the Bucks with a contract of 2.6 million a year. team. Korver's career 3-point shooting rate is as high as 42.9%. He is a phenomenal three-pointer. His joining will greatly increase the hope that the Bucks will rush out of the East.
Ranked sixth is Tyson Chandler, who just joined the Rockets, and played a total of 1,134 games. The boxing champion will also help the new dual-core Rockets become a popular team for the championship.

​
Ranked seventh is Andre Iguodala, who was traded to the Grizzlies by the Warriors, and played a total of 1,108 games. The former FMVP couldn't change the game because of the injury, but when the team needed it, Iguodala would also open the coffin board to become an important part of the game.
The next three active NBA players were Pachulia (1098 games), Carmelo Anthony (1064 games) and Dwight Howard (1044 games).
The deceased, such as Steve, stayed up late. I hope that fans will cherish every game of the players, cherish every inch of our time watching the ball, the old is not only the career of the players, but also our youth.
