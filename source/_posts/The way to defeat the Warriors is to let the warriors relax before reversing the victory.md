The Clippers made history today in Auckland, at the home of defending champion Golden State Warriors, in front of 19596 spectators at Oracle Stadium.
The Warriors entered the fourth quarter with a 14-point lead, but were eventually reversed.
In the history of the NBA playoffs, the team leading by 14 points into the fourth quarter had won 110 consecutive victories before, which was terminated by the Clippers today!

The Clippers completed a tremendous reversal with a maximum of 31 points behind, which is also the biggest reversal difference in the history of the NBA playoffs.
As Beverly Twitter, one of the absolute contributors to the Clippers'reversal of the game, put it: Glory to God! The Clipper's super toughness enabled them to win God's favor and complete this miraculous reversal.
They are a group of respectable players. They are a more respectable group.
Difficult, the way to defeat the Golden State Warriors is to let the defending champion hold the lead first, then relax, and finally work hard to reverse the victory?

# It's not once or twice that the Warriors relax after taking the lead.
The Warriors have been reversed a lot, especially in the last two seasons.
In the playoffs, it was obvious that last year's Western Final G4, the Warriors also led by 10 points into the fourth quarter, and were eventually reversed by the Rockets.
That rocket reversal was mainly due to the absence of a brother, and today's reversal, the key point is the Fouls of Curie and Durant.
The Warriors almost overwhelmed the Clippers in the first half. The third quarter just came up and hit a wave of current, directly pulling the difference to 31 points. But Kuri committed two fouls in the first quarter, got the third foul in the second quarter, and soon got the fourth foul in the third quarter.
But for protective reasons, Cole took Curie off the court directly. Most importantly, at the end of the third quarter, when the Clippers continued to cut off the momentum, Cole did not choose to take back the team's most stable holding point and the biggest threat from the outside Kuri.
It was only in the last attack at the end of the third quarter that Cole chose to put Curie and Durant on the court for the final attack at the same time.
After a long rest in Curie, the first half of the hot feeling of cold. The Clippers were not confident enough to shoot after the break-up, but it was a mistake in passing, and the Clippers also got 2 points against the whistle.
At the end of the third quarter, the Clippers had only 14 points left behind the Warriors, which was already a dangerous difference.

# Rotation is the biggest weakness, but the Warriors did not intentionally cover it up.
The Warriors'reserve line-up this year is the weakest in recent years, which I have stated many times. But in the playoffs, Cole still hasn't made any adjustments to cover up this weakness.
As I have mentioned before, the weakness of the rotation team is that because of the wealthy configuration of the Warriors'team, Cole can completely split several of the Warriors' stars and use them in pairs to help the Warriors transition.
By contrast, the Clippers have the strongest reserve team in the league. Louis and Harrell not only have strong scoring ability in their respective positions, but also their block and tear-up is the end of the Clippers'killing tactics.
In the phase of rotation, the Warriors'non-starting line-up has no way to block and disassemble Luwe and Harrel, basically allowing the group to score frantically.
In today's game, there are many situations in which Curie and Durant are not present at the same time. Clay's role at the offensive end of the series was almost minimal because of the crazy chase and tearing of Clippers.
So if Curie and Durant are not present at the same time, and Cosins is injured and left, the shortcomings of the Warriors'presence can be said to be infinitely magnified.

​
For example, with 2 minutes left in the third quarter, when Lowe's 2+1 was only 16 points left, Durant was replaced. The line-up was Green, Cook, Brother One, Luni and McKinney, which lasted one round and Cole replaced Clay. But when Clay was put on guard, it still didn't make much difference.

# Leadership relaxation also represents the Warriors'lack of concentration and disrespect for their opponents.
The playoffs are no better than the regular season, not to mention the Warriors'goal is to win three consecutive championships, but they lost a home court in the second game of the first round. The Warriors lost their first home game in the playoffs in 2014, and the last time the Warriors lost their first home game to the Clippers.
Of course, the Clippers of that time and the Clippers of today are human beings. But the Clippers'resilience has always been there, and the players' efforts and perseverance have never been lost.
Even if we look back at the first game, the Warriors are only a dozen points ahead in the last four minutes or so, and the Warriors'starting line-up does not rest until about two minutes are completely locked in.
But in today's game, when the Clippers started, the Warriors were not only unable to respond, Cole did not call a timeout to make adjustments. The Warriors'team and even the fans may have thought that if they were so much ahead, they could still lose to you.

​
Beverly's pressure on Durant disappeared because of Beverly's six fouls, but Durant had already committed five fouls to cover up the six fouls.
The most trustworthy Durant at the critical moment went down, after a long rest, Kuri came up and lost all four shots, Clay's key arc top three points were slightly off, so the Warriors have gone.

The Clippers can accomplish this miraculous reversal, which is of course worthy of respect. They are incredibly resilient. Of course, we have to say that if the Warriors stay focused, the Clippers will be as breathless as they were in the first half.
This hard-won victory is a heartbreaking stimulus for all the Clippers, and failure is also a heavy blow and warning for the scattered Golden State Warriors.

The Warriors must realize that all the opponents in the playoff arena deserve to be valued and respected, and that winning every game requires hard work.
This amazing reversal only represents the beginning of the series.
