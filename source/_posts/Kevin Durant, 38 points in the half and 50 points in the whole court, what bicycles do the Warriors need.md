​
It was originally a series of games in which both coaches showed their wisdom. At least Rivers and the Clippers tried their best to create problems for the Warriors. Cole or the Warriors also made some adjustments to the Clippers'targeting.
But at the end of the series, Durant again disrupted everyone's layout, including the Clippers, including the Warriors.
Durant seems to be showing that what fucking tactics are not tactical and that you can't win the last game with 45 points? That's 50 points.
Of course, some of the data are just appearances. Let's see why Durant's performance in the first three games is so different from that in the last three.

# The aim of the Clippers'whole series and Durant's incomprehension
In the first three games, Rivers's approach was to target Durant.
The arrowhead they sent was Beverly, and it turned out that Beverly's entanglement was very uncomfortable with Durant, who was not accustomed to this level of confrontation.
As a result, Beverly's struggle in the first two matches was very effective, and he almost offset Durant's existence at the expense of cashmere.
In the first game, Durant fought the whole game and was expelled in the last two. In the second game, Durant scored 21 points from 5-for-8, but he made nine playoff mistakes with the Clippers'defense. At the end of the game, his full departure became the key point for the Warriors to be reversed.

​
But after Game 3, Durant opened the lid on his offensive end. His anger was so high that no one could stop him.
In the last four games, Durant averaged 41.5 points and shot 57.3%, which was horrible.
In fact, Durant also scored an average of 35 points, 5.3 rebounds and 5.3 assists in the series with 56.7%, 40% and 94.9% hits.
After finding a solution to Beverly's tussle in Game 3, Rivers quickly adjusted and began writing defensive articles about Curie.
Durant's attacking environment was too comfortable when rival teams began to write about Curie and Clay. His unsolved singles will despair the enemy again and again.
Last season's Western Finals against Tucker, Paul and Ariza all scored an average of 30.4 points per game, defensive resources are obviously not as good as last year's Rockets Clippers, Kevin Durant is obviously unable to deal with this natural mistake.

# Durant of G6 disrupted the deployment of both sides
In fact, as Cole was forced to adjust for the first time today, the Warriors were trying to win the game defensively.
They swapped in the starting line-up, removed Bogut and took Livingston, considering a counterpoint issue.
Clipper launches: Beverly, Alexander, Shamet, Galinari and Jamaco-Green, each of which seems to have a little projective power.
Before the Warriors did not adjust, Jamako-Green played very well in the G5, and his three-point outside line actually gave the Warriors some of the first defense.
But when the Warriors made adjustments to replace Livingston, they were also able to get on the speed and agility of the Clippers. Because the Clippers are actually a three-guard system, Alexander is more like a swing guard, but he plays more defensively.
However, judging from the actual situation in the first and third quarters of the game, the Warriors'starting adjustment actually hurt themselves.
Livingston has no outside shooting, Dream-chasing Green all teams will choose to let go of their shooting, the first two points did not shoot, the Clippers can arbitrarily pack the library, find people to defend against Clay and Durant can hold the Warriors attack.
Curie's few opening chances are also affected by this reason. Clay hardly has any mobile phone chances. When the ball stops in Levin's and dream-pursuing hands, they have to go to Durant.

​
But the problem is Durant.
Durant said in an interview before the game that "the team did not start well", which means that he knows it is very important to start well against a team like the Clippers. When the team's offense is targeted, it is necessary for him to stand out as a super singles player.
Not only did Durant stand out, but his footsteps shook Staples'entire stadium.
In the first quarter, Durant's mid-shot and his resolute offensive basketball scored 15 points in a single quarter, and the Clippers'performance of 15 points in a single quarter is no wonder. They didn't do anything about Durant.
Durant scored 23 points in the second quarter, the main reason for his outbreak was his three consecutive points.
I have to say that when Durant, who is a CIC watchdog, can hit three consecutive points, the Clippers'dump obviously came a little too slowly.
Of course, the Clippers only have five players who can play, and they need to be careful about the presence of Curie and Clay, which is not difficult to understand. But they really underestimated Durant's desire to attack in the half-match.

# The Warriors'defense is still online, mostly for Luwe and Harrel.
The first adjustment was to put Luni and Luni on the bench and follow Luvi and Harrel up and down together, aiming at Luvi and Harrel.
So this game, the serious Warriors, through the defensive restriction of Luwey 21 to 3 shots, Harrell was limited to only 10 points. This is far below the average of their series.
When the combination of Luwe and Harrel did not work, it was clear that the Clippers could not rise.
Even though their starter Garinali scored a playoff high of 29 points, and Alexander still did a good job of 22+5+6, they were not enough to beat the Warriors.
The two lost games are also obvious. If the Warriors can't disassemble the combination of Louis and Harrel and their blocks, the Warriors will be in a very difficult situation.
With the overall level of the Warriors, they can also compete with the Clippers, they have this ability, but two careless losses in Jingzhou let the Warriors understand the postseason defensive attitude required.

​
Dream of today's four blocks, Clay's three blocks, Durant's nail-plate cap against Gallinari, Igodara's three steals, Clayyigo's whole game of pressure and stealing when Louis held the ball, and the Warriors'quick organized counter-attack, all these are the Warriors' response after playing carelessly.
Defensive oppression, Durant explosion on the offensive end, Green dispatch, stable output of Curie, even if Clay feels bad, the warriors are enough to win the opponent.

There is a Durant who can score 38 points in the playoffs and 50 points in the playoffs. Sometimes strange tactics or rotation can be less. In the key rounds, what bicycles do Warriors and Cole need?
