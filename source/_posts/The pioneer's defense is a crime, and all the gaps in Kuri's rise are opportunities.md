# The pitcher's so-called rhythm and feeling
Kuri's first two three-point shots were all in the front box, and only three of his first nine shots were hit. When people began to worry about Kuri's finger injuries, Kuri's first three-point came unexpectedly.
The first three points is the familiar Kuri chase false gear removal, and then Kuri around a small bend to the bottom right corner, even though the two Blazers defensive players have noticed Kuri's movements.
But on the one hand, Kuri has too many choices after catching the ball. The pioneer defenders dare not attack and defend easily. On the other hand, they do not make any difficulties for Kuri's catching. Their pinch may be so slow that 0.5 seconds is enough for Kuri to catch and shoot very quickly and enter the net hollow.

Bogut once said, "If you've been with different players, some combinations don't fit, because the players often think,'All the balls pass my hand, I have to control everything. Stephen, however, was willing not to get a chance in three or four minutes because he knew he could open the game with a wave of three or four points.
"It was in that situation that he realized:'I need my teammates to be involved as well. So everyone gets better, and that attitude has a ripple effect.
The significance of this passage is not only the scoring explosive power of the unique team in the Curie League, but also the basis of the Warriors'team basketball.

The Blazers were actually quite cautious. They called a timeout immediately after Curry's first three-point hit. Maybe Coach Stotts was not satisfied with the team's defense against Curry.
But when the first three points of Curie came, they were somewhat irresistible. Especially the eight consecutive points before the end of the midfield, a three-point line outside worship Buddha burst into the inside of the pick-up rebound, a three-point arc top block, the last round of the nearly lost ball after picking up the ball to elegant three-point backward, it is somewhat unreasonable.
This is the so-called rhythm and feeling. After the first three-point hit, Curie will probably burst into a burst at a later stage, so that the opponent can not be caught off guard. Within a minute, Curie will get eight points, just three rounds of things.

# The pioneer's defense against disassembly is a crime.
In fact, the Blazers'own defensive strategy is obviously problematic, because Curie can shoot three points with such ease and ease.
Can you imagine that the pioneers will bet the game on the three points of the Kuri or half-space? When Curie was able to shoot through the sky with his super-gods, the pioneers did choose a way to test Curie by "I throw you, you have the ability to throw me to death".
Or did Kuri's last series of three-point shooting against the Rockets give the Blazers an illusion?
Anyway, the chance came to Curie. Stephen Curie, one of the best opportunists in the league, did not hesitate to score 9 points in the playoff record of his playoff career. He beat the trailblazers like a falling flower.

This is Stephen Curie! It has gradually been recognized by everyone as the first three-point shooter in history, the three-point record holder in the regular season and the three-point record holder in the playoffs.
Even in the intense playoffs, Curie's three-point shooting rate remained steady at more than 40% throughout his career. However, the pioneer gambled on his hit rate, a decision that was even somewhat ironic.
Of course, maybe you can also feel their helplessness from interviewing Coach Stotts after the game.
After the game, reporters asked Stotts why they did not choose to double Curie like other teams before.
"I don't remember clearly. He scored 33 points in the second half of the game, did he? It was the Rockets that dumped him and then he scored 33 points in the second half, right? (Slater replies: Yes) That's OK. We'll think about it."

In the face of the rocket's extremely targeted dump, Curie can score 33 points at half-time. The Blazers'defensive resources are of course slightly inferior to those of the Rockets.
If you don't choose to change defense, Kuri shoots Capella in the last game, plays Tucker and shakes hands three points, and shoots the basket after playing against Hacles in this game, and Baifo throws the super high board outside the three-point line into the inside line, all of which are the end of the defense depot.
And it's a Curie with a finger injury.
So the pioneers dare not even expose the slow-moving Cantor to the library, which will be thrown into the brilliant collection of Curie's career like Gobel in 2017.
So, it seems that there is no other way to limit Curie except to shoot in Curie and try to make the defenders play with a slight limit on interference.
But, really give Kuri a lot of good opportunities, Kuri is fully capable of doing the field to you into 8-9 three-point men.

# Finding a sense in Curie is the most dangerous situation in the alliance.
This is the power of Kuri. None of the other three-point shooters in the league can achieve the same output and quality that Curie maintains on the three-point line.
When Curie finds the feeling beyond the three-point line, the great fear that gives his opponent and the many low-level defensive omissions caused by his opponent's defensive system will completely collapse the defensive team's system.
Popularly speaking, it's what fans like to hear. It's gravitational.

​
Today, not only is Kuri's singles three points, holding the ball to block three-point arrows like rain, the second half was forced to put defensive attention on Kuri's more pioneers, but also Kuri's gravitational scourge.
In the second half of the game, and more than once Kuri's ball-less position directly attracted the attention of the Blazers 2-3 defensive players, and then Luni or a brother directly cut into the inside line to receive Green's pass and dunk directly.

​
This happens repeatedly even in the last 4-5 minutes of the game. At a time when the pioneers need to catch up, the goal is a huge blow to their confidence and enthusiasm.
And when they changed their defensive position again, Curie got another chance to get a half-space on the right side through one-stop, three points in the middle.
"How do you play it?" This kind of mentality not only appears on the field, sometimes you can also feel this kind of mentality from the body language of NBA players.

It must be the most dangerous situation in the league and the least desirable situation for all warriors. Curie may only need one or two balls to get into shape, and any defensive gap he sees after that, even if it's just a 0.5 second slip, could lead to three-point bombardment one after another.
Fans have seen this situation many times in the regular season, and it can happen in the playoffs, which shows that the pioneers are really in big trouble.
