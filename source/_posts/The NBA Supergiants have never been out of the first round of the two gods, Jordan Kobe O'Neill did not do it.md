​
In today's league, there are only 6-7 super stars, which can actually be counted one by one.
Super stars like Curie, Durant and James, Kawaii, who won the championship last season, and Harden, who made horrible performances in the regular season last season, plus the MVP alphabet brother last season, are basically undisputed.

​
However, among the six supergiants, there were also hibernation in the early stages of their careers. For example, Kury suffered serious injuries in the first three years of his career. His first entry into the playoffs was in the 2012-13 season. Of course, Kury's first entry into the playoffs has shown the explosive power of scoring that shocked the basketball world. He scored in the first round and scored in the following rounds. Kim, in the second round against the old Spurs, the Warriors'youth storm is actually worse than that experience.
In the following season of 2013-14, they lost to the Clippers in the first round without major generals. From the beginning of the season of 2014-15, the Warriors really rose completely.

​
Although Alphabet Brother's entire career is still growing, but before the Bucks'strength is relatively general, the record is only the midstream level. From the beginning of the 2014-15 season, Alphabet Brother has stopped the first round of the playoffs for three consecutive years, only this year's MVP season rushed to the Eastern Finals regrettably defeated.
Harden is actually both lucky and powerful. He has never missed the playoffs in his career, but he has been out in the first round in his rookie days at Thunder and in three years of Rockets'seven-year career.

​
Leonard's previous playoff career has been following the Spurs, but even if the Spurs have not been able to play regularly in the past 20 years, there are also moments when the Spurs lost their front foot. In the 2014-15 season, the Spurs lost the Clippers in the first seven games, which is the only first time that Leonard was out.
Durant entered the playoffs with his young Thunder in the 2009-2010 season. Although Durant averaged 25 points per game, his first entry into the playoffs was obviously not well adapted to the rhythm of the game. His shooting percentage was only 35%, and they were eventually defeated by the Lakers in the first round.

​
Of the six superstars in active service, only LeBron James has never experienced a first-round exit in his career. In fact, only LeBron James and "Lord of the Rings" Russell have never tasted the first-round exit.
LeBron James has been in the playoffs 13 times since the third season of his career. He has never been out of the first round. The worst result is in the semi-finals.

​
James averaged 30.8 points, 8.1 rebounds and 5.8 assists throughout the playoffs in the 2005-06 season. Although they made 5 mistakes per game, they won the Wizards 4-2 in the first round, and the Pistons in the second round and the stubborn Pistons in the next seven games. In the 2006-07 season, the Cavaliers were in that position. But under the leadership of James I, he crossed the Pistons and reached the Finals.
Russell, who had 11 championship rings and completed eight consecutive championships, had never been out of the first round in his career. Although there were fewer NBA teams in that era, it was not easy to maintain this competitiveness for as long as 10 years.

Apart from these two great gods, there are countless superstars in NBA history, but even the most dazzling ones have failed to accomplish what they never did in the first round.
Jordan scored 63 points, the highest in NBA playoff history, against defending champion Celtics in the early stages of his career playoffs, but he could not escape the first round exit.

​
Kobe Bryant's first-round exit is also many, the early Lakers career, and the period after the break-up with O'Neill, Kobe Bryant has experienced the first-round exit, 06-07 season that average 32.8 points Kobe, still can not really compete with a team.

​
There's O'Neill, whose dominance at the top is naturally horrible, but he went through the first round of exits in his juvenile shark days and later in his career.
