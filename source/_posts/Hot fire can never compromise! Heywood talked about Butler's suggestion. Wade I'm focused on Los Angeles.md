Jimmy Butler landed in Miami this summer and became the new emperor of the Heat. After Wade retired, the Heat have been looking for a superstar to lead the team. Butler is undoubtedly the most suitable player, he is diligent and enterprising. Butler is not strong in terms of physical talent, even a little mediocre.
Because Butler is 2.01 metres high on the flank and has a poor 2.03 metres arms. This limits Butler's ceiling, otherwise he might be even stronger now.
Well, Butler's current level is also superstar. What can we judge whether a player is a superstar or not? It's to lead the team into the playoffs.

Only the players who lead the mononuclear team into the playoffs can be considered real superstars. While Butler was at the bulls, he led the team into the playoffs. When we went to the Timberwolves, we also brought the team of Ten Thousand Years Fish Bowl into the playoffs, which broke the two gifted monsters of Wiggins and Downs.
If Wiggins'talent were given to Butler, it would be doubtful who would be the first in the current coalition. How much influence does Butler have on the team? Butler had previously revealed that he was getting up at 3:30 a.m. every day and then going to the gym to practice hard.
Butler is looking forward to being the boss of the Heat. He dreams of being the boss. The Heat will undoubtedly regard him as the real core. It was a pity that the Heat missed the playoffs last season.

But Butler has one disadvantage that he doesn't know if he will change, that is, he has a strong desire to control. Whether it's a bull or a timber wolf, the dressing room explodes. Because Butler likes to control his teammates, it will not satisfy some young people.
This was especially mentioned by former NBA player Brandon Heywood on his visit to NBA TV. Heywood believes Butler has to learn from the past, as he influenced the entire dressing room when the bulls and Timberwolves played.
Now joining the Heat, Heywood believes that Butler should be more temperamental, not to allow coach Spollestra and God operator Riley difficult to do.

"Butler can be integrated into the hot culture, but I hope he can learn from his past failures," Heywood said. He spoiled the atmosphere in the dressing room when he was working with the bulls and the timberwolves. Everyone is wondering what kind of player Butler is. As a player, I think Butler is perfect. Last season, at a critical moment for 76 players, Butler was the first point of possession, not Simmons and Embed. So I don't think it's a problem for Butler to integrate into the Heat. But off the court, I hope Butler can respect the team culture of the Heat, because the Heat will never compromise because of any individual.

Yes, Heywood warned Butler that you can play freely on the court and you have unlimited right to fire. But don't try to turn the Heat into your own world off the court.
Because this is not Butler's, the city's winning culture was built by Wade. But Wade didn't care whether Butler could join the team or not.
A reporter asked Wade. Do you have any suggestions for Butler? Wade made a suggestion, hoping Butler would lead the team to a seat in the east.

As for his relationship with the Heat, Wade believes his current focus is on developing in Los Angeles. His wife is in Los Angeles and he has no time to watch Miami. Wade said: "I haven't paid much attention to Miami lately because I've had a good time in Los Angeles and I can focus on my daughter's growth. And again, I'm not ready to return. I'm used to retirement.  
There is LeBron James in Los Angeles. It's worth mentioning that Wade bought a luxury house in Los Angeles the moment James joined the Lakers.
