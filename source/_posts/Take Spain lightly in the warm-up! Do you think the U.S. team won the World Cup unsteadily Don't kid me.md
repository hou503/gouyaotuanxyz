When many of the past stars of the U.S. team withdrew one after another, when the U.S. team lost the match to the accompanying team, when the star light of the U.S. team seems to have reached the lowest point in history, people think that the U.S. is really as unstable as Kobe said.
But the fact is, whether in terms of odds or strength, the U.S. team still occupies the absolute top of the World Cup.
As an Australian player said before, even if the United States withdraws many players, such a team is still better than any existing NBA-level team. After all, all the players of this team are NBA starters, and the NBA-level team, even the five-star starters like the Warriors last season. Their substitutes are also at the bottom of the league.
Such a team, even going to the NBA, has the strength to compete for the NBA championship, so when it comes to the World Cup, it will lose its dominance? This is unreasonable.
Today, the warm-up match between the United States and Spain is a very telling story.
In this game, the United States eventually took Spain 90-81 lightly, Spain also relied on the last minute to grab three points before the score reached double digits.
On the American side, Mitchell scored the highest 13 points, Walker scored 11 points, 6 rebounds and 8 assists, Tatum scored 11 points, 5 rebounds and 4 rebounds and 2 rebounds, Spain's Rubio scored 16 points, 3 rebounds and 7 rebounds and Pau Gasol scored 19 points, 3 rebounds and 2 caps.

Spain is also an old strong team in international competitions. As the former world champion team, their team is still quite strong in strength although it is aging. Such a team, with Rubio, Pau Gasol, Hernan Gomez and other NBA players in Spain, and the United States team warming-up game, it can be predicted that the quality of the game will not be low.
From the opening point of view, the two sides did have some tit-for-tat meanings. Spain's half-court offense was led by Rubio and Gasol, who cooperated well with each other. Rubio's mid-range projection, and the tandem scoring were more comfortable in the national team system, while Gasol's offensive countermeasure and the defensive side's sitting in the middle of the field, let him play. Spain's Offensive-Defensive balance.

Wal and Mitchell are the first and second players sent by the United States team. Of course, from the point of view of the rotation of the whole game, the match between the two players has not played a very good effect. The existence of Pau Gasol has limited their breakthroughs.
On the guard line, the United States team also has Derek White, Joe Harris and White's role at both ends of the offense and defense is remarkable, but Joe Harris's projection is very limited by Spain's rapid co-defense.
However, the United States team's front-line combination showed a better performance, Barnes did not have many opportunities to play this game, the main opportunities are in the hands of Tatum, Jay Brown, Middleton and Kuzma.
The four front lines, Tatum and Jay Brown have better impact, and the end near the basket is more stable. Middleton's three-point and mid-distance make him more adaptable to the rules of FIBA. Kuzma's fast down, three-point rush and bottom-slip also play a good role. The combination of front lines is the United States team's own game instead. A more splendid place.

​
The interior might have been the most worrying position for the U.S. team, but in fact, the three interiors that the U.S. team brought, Lopez had guards and three points, Turner's front rebounds and blocked shots, and Pramley's spare parts, were enough to deal with most of the international situation.
It is worth mentioning that the three-point ability of the U.S. team is probably the most easily overlooked but also the most powerful place. Their players basically have the ability to shoot from the outside. In this game, the three-point help the U.S. team to take the lead in opening up the situation.
Of course, at the end of the game, Spain once worked hard to get the score close, neither side really entered the state of tearing, the United States team in the first half, Spain in the second half significantly strengthened the defense, both sides are satisfied with the results of this game.

Don't forget, even if many stars retire, the difficulty of winning the World Cup is only from easy to general.
