At the beginning of the game, the Lakers played a wave of 11-2, mainly showing a lot of aggression at the defensive end, only playing for more than 2 minutes, the Lakers sent out three blocks, thick eyebrows sent out, two times directly to the outside line, giving the heat a lot of defensive pressure outside the line, while Butler in the tangle of Dani green, has not yet received the ball. The Lakers haven't attacked much, mainly because there are a lot of opportunities here in Bradley. He can shoot three points at a fixed point, can hold the ball and shoot with cover. James and bushmei haven't started yet. The Lakers have played a good start advantage.
After drajic came back, the heat had an extra attack point, Butler also increased his personal attack, the Lakers threw a bad three-point shot, the difference was quickly caught up. Generally speaking, the shooting rate of the long-range projection of both sides in the first quarter was very poor. The Lakers' pop and Kuzma didn't make much contribution after coming on as substitutes. Caruso provided a strong defense and a smash dunk. In the first quarter, the Lakers and the heat were 28-21, and Howard didn't get a chance in the first quarter.

In the next quarter, James played a very smooth attack with the substitute, and every player was willing to share the ball. But the heat made two three-point shots on the outside line in a row, and Dragic attacked in series, bringing the difference close to three points. James didn't come out in time to score, but kept passing the ball to his teammates. Even if there was a vacancy, he didn't throw it. The basketball seemed to play well.
After Caruso came off the court, the Lakers began to lose their offense, and they didn't play a good attack and defense conversion when they were in the thick eyebrows. In the last three minutes, the Lakers changed Howard into a small team, but they didn't play a relatively good attack. James still didn't start the attack mode. He was passing the ball all the time and organizing the attack all the time. The heat had a lot of opportunities, but fortunately, the hit rate was not high. The Lakers still had two points before the end of the half, playing 46-48.

In the third quarter of the game, the Lakers started to improve the defense intensity. In almost half of the game, the heat only got 4 points. Although James was still rowing, he didn't play as hard as before, but he occasionally snapped a lift. The Lakers mainly relied on the conversion of attack and defense to expand the comparative advantage to 8 points.
James was fouled maliciously by Leonard in a breakthrough, and was slapped directly. It's estimated that he could not hold his face after he was kicked off by James in front, and wanted to revenge. But after the foul, the Lakers were more aggressive, the defense was more fierce, James was also more aggressive, the bottom corner into three points, the difference opened to 11 points. In the last three minutes, Vogel replaced Kuzma, still without Howard, put Kuzma and pop on the court, the defense was worse, but fortunately, under the guidance of bushmei, he did not lose points in this period. At the end of the third section, the two sides played 78-66.
At the end of the game, the Lakers dropped two main players and used the team that beat the bulls in the fourth quarter, Howard + Kuzma + kaluso and other pure substitutes, but this time it was not so easy. Dragic scored five points in a row, two rounds, one and a half minutes to stop the Lakers, and Vogel had to change back to James to stabilize the rhythm.

In the last five minutes of the last quarter, the Lakers replaced Howard, went to a relatively small lineup, bushbrow + James + three guards, and Caruso increased the defensive strength and holding points. Butler was consumed a little seriously, and the Lakers as a whole stabilized the difference at 8 points. In about two minutes, James scored two three-point shots, extending the difference to 15 points, basically killing the game. Interestingly, the heat and the bulls have one thing in common in this game, that is, in the last period of time, the Lakers' high-intensity defense made the heat fail to score in nearly 7 minutes. By defense, the Lakers won 7 consecutive games, and the two sides finally achieved 95-80.
In the whole game, James played 36 minutes, 10 of 19 shots, 7 of 3 shots, 4 of 7 shots, got 25 + 4 + 6, 3 mistakes, plus or minus value + 16, James didn't play well in the first three quarters, and his desire was not very strong, but he stood out in the fourth quarter, especially the two key three points, which became the direct factor to end the game. In 11 of 17 shots, bushmei got 26 points, 8 rebounds, 7 assists, 2 steals, 3 blocks and 2 mistakes, with a positive and negative value of + 27. There is basically no player in the inner line of the heat who can limit bushmei. The inner line score is too easy. The heat's strategy for him is not to let him go to the paint area. In addition, it's a free throw, isn't it?

Butler only got 22 points in this game. The defense of the Lakers' outside line and front line was too much for him. He only played twice in the last critical moment, and didn't go out at all in the rest of the time. Bradley, Denny green and Caruso from the outside line defended him in a wheel game. He was waiting for him when he went to the inside line.
Finally know, the Lakers defense efficiency, why is the League first.
