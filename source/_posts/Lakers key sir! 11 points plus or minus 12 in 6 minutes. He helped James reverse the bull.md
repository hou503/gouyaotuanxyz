The Lakers struggled to win their sixth straight win in Chicago, a game James played brilliantly and repeatedly stood up at critical moments to withstand the pressure. When teammates make mistakes and the defense is not focused, it's him who carries the team by scoring. When the Lakers are nearly 20 points behind, it's James who helps the team stabilize the situation by hitting the inside line with the most disliked and tired scoring method.

However, it's not James who really beat the score and reversed the bulls. This man was supposed to be bushmei, but bushmei's performance in this game was a bit bad. He got 15 points and 7 rebounds from 6 of 15 shots in the whole game. He performed well in the defensive end, showing a defensive aggressiveness of the best defensive player level, but he was a little weak in the offensive end. In the first three quarters, he only got 8 points, and his hit rate was very low. He was also plagued by the number of fouls, so in the third quarter At the beginning of the four quarters, he was supposed to lead the substitute on the court, and became a pure substitute team with Kuzma as the core.
Kuzma is a key figure in the Lakers' reversal of the bulls. James is certainly the core element of winning this game. Without his stable play in the first three quarters, the Lakers could not reach the fourth quarter at all, and Kuzma's play in the fourth quarter became a turning point of the whole game.

Like bushmei, Kuzma was in a very bad condition in the first three quarters. Not only was he unable to play on the offensive side, but also he didn't contribute on the defensive side, and even made low-level mistakes. It may have something to do with his physical recovery and his long absence from the battle, but Vogel didn't let him go, still trusted him and gave him a chance.
Kuzma played the whole game for 21 minutes, 16 shots 7, 15 points 4 rebounds. In the first three quarters of the game, he scored 4 points in 2 of 8 shots, and his three-point touch could not be found all the time. If we have to say some objective reasons, that is, when Kuzma and any one of the two superstars are present at the same time, his self-confidence may be affected. Some of the balls are not very decisive, many of them are facing the defense and shooting, and they are not opportunities at all. But in the pure second line-up, Kuzma was obviously very open. In the fourth quarter, Kuzma played 6 minutes, got 11 points and 2 rebounds from 5 of 8 shots, plus or minus 12 points in a single quarter. Under Kuzma's leadership, the Lakers surpassed the bulls in a wave of attacks.

At the beginning of the fourth quarter, Kuzma received Caruso's pass, which was not a good chance, but Kuzma made it, because if he didn't make it, other people's grasp was even less, Kuzma's self-confidence was very high. Then, through Howard's cover, he received cook's pass, shook off the defender, took the ball to the inside, layup and scored. In the third goal, Kuzma received the baseline service with 4 seconds left. Facing the defender, Kuzma decisively chose to break through. After breaking through, no one from the Bulls came to assist the defense, threw and hit and caused a foul.
At the beginning of this season, the Lakers played a wave of 16-0 direct game to surpass the score, but there was no James, no eyebrows, the main attack point was Kuzma. In fact, this set of lineup should have worried people, because Kuzma's hand feel is not good since he came back, other players have not played well in this game, the three strongest 3D players pop, Danny green and Bradley are not in, and the attack efficiency of the Lakers should be the worst.

But it's good that Kuzma found his hand. Otherwise, the Lakers would be hard to survive in this period of time without dual core. If the difference between James and bushmei was widened after they came back in the second half of the game, it would be very difficult for the bushmei, who was already very tired, to reverse the game again because they were in the first three quarters None of them can reach the climax of attack. It's only by James holding the explosive bag and rushing to the inner line to get back to 10 points. This scoring method is not suitable for James for a long time, and it can take up to 3 minutes.
For the Lakers, it's not just a six game winning streak, they're relieved at last, because Kuzma has finally found a state. If Kuzma, known as the third core of the Lakers, can open his hand and play at a general level, he can greatly reduce the scoring pressure of bushbrow in the second team. He doesn't have to play low-level singles in every round. If he meets a team like Spurs It's hard to use the same tactics to play the second round after one round. At this time, someone needs to stand up and score. This person must be Kuzma.

However, one thing to say is that Kuzma's biggest threat is to catch the jump shot without the ball end and hit the basket with the help of the cover instead of holding the ball. This game is a highly efficient performance of Kuzma when he leads the team alone, but it will take a long time for him to have a chemical reaction with the thick eyebrow.
