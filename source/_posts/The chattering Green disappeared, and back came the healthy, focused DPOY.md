Green's weight loss is very important for the Warriors'team as a whole.
So far in the playoffs, the data and performance of Chasing Dream Green are perfect.
Sixty-six regular season games averaged only 7.4 points, which is the lowest since the 2014-15 season for Chasing Dream Green. His three-point shooting rate has dropped again and again to a low of 31.
Even in the past, Green's defense, which has been able to gain a foothold in the league, seems to have declined significantly in the regular season.
However, since entering the playoffs, the performance of pursuing dreams has indeed ushered in a comprehensive rebound. This change has made the Warriors steadfastly come to the stage of the Western Conference even though they have encountered many difficulties.
After two rounds of training, the Golden State Warriors are now holding the Western Finals, one step away from the fifth consecutive Finals.
In this process, Dream Green averaged 13.3 points, 9.5 rebounds and 8.0 assists, in addition to 1.27 steals and 1.67 blocked shots.
Dream-chasing three-point shooting has also been actively reduced. The proportion of basketball impact and fast break in his personal offense has increased significantly. The shooting percentage of 52.3% is significantly higher than that of 44.5% in the regular season.

​
Of course, there is no reason for this change. The reason why Dream Chasing can magically regain DPOY status in the past few years is closely related to his weight loss in the regular season.
Warrior GM Bob Miles and Warrior Team found their dreams in March and gave their personal advice on weight loss, body recovery, and proper diet.
So the whole team of warriors began to make plans for Dream Chasing Green, and Dream Chasing began to follow and implement.
There are special dietitians to guide dream-chasing diet, dream-chasing menus and menus provided by special chefs. Team strength trainers formulate detailed training plans for dream-chasing, so that he can keep up with strength training while losing weight.
In six weeks, before the playoffs, Chasing Dream Green lost 23 pounds through this program, and also adjusted to the best physical condition for the playoffs.
Therefore, we saw the healthy and light dream-chasing Green break out when the team faced difficulties in the Warriors'Western Final against Trail Blazers G3.

​
Chasing Dream got three pairs of data at the end of three quarters, and cut 20 points, 13 baskets, 12 assists, 4 steals and 1 cover in the whole game. His figure was almost everywhere.
Chasing Dream Green's perfect performance in the third quarter also helped the double-digit Golden State Warriors complete the second consecutive single-quarter reversal of the third quarter.
Chasing Dream Green's "internal combustion engine" energy is perfectly converted into the Warriors'engine, even if there are some breakdowns, but the Warriors' power is still full, their "core parts" are still running smoothly, which is an important reason why they are currently overwhelmed in the Western Decision.

​
The energy provided by pursuing dreams is the premise of all this. Dream-chasing health, as a prerequisite for his energy, comes from that crucial suggestion and that important weight loss.
Speaking of this year's playoffs, Durant's right calf, a brother's left calf, Clay's ankle, Curie's ankle and finger dislocation, Cosins thigh, the Warriors in addition to dream, other core members are more or less affected by injuries.
At this moment, the health of pursuing dreams and their exertion are more important. His existence makes the three-time championship of the warriors go forward steadily, though bumpy.

** Enlightenment of Children's Words on Dream Pursuit**
The 2016 champion's regretful mistake plunged the entire Warriors team into deep self-blame and reflection, including Dream Chasing Green.
In the summer of 2016, Chasing Dream Green also formed a group of his personal network, which was used to provide some business, professional and personal life advice for Chasing Dream.
This group of close relatives, friends and industry leaders who pursue dreams has actually helped them grow up a lot.
What's more, after that, chasing dreams also ushered in the birth of his son. The existence of children makes the dream of becoming a father feel heavy responsibility again.

In today's interview, Dreamchase also mentioned, "The influence of the NBA is really great. Many children will watch the game. They regard us as idols. Our behavior has a great impact on them. After that, I will be cautious about my behavior on the court and not lead the children in the wrong direction.
The biggest teacher for children is actually their parents, who consciously or unconsciously imitate their parents'behavior. As their children grow up, their language and behavior learning abilities become stronger and stronger, and their imitation and learning of their parents will become deeper and deeper.
When their children still learn some irrational behavior on the court, they begin to realize their mistakes.
So Dreamchase began to control his emotions, as he said, not to argue too much with the referee, but to focus more quickly on the next round of the game.
When the mood is the most unstable, the easiest to erupt and sometimes hurt the team's dream-chasing Green, when he starts to become extremely calm and self-restrained, the Golden State Warriors will become dangerous, will become highly disciplined, they will rarely make fatal mistakes, so they will be stronger.
Children's words bring enlightenment and growth to the pursuit of dreams, which is certainly the scene that the Warriors are most happy to see. After all, because of technical fouls and banned from the game, they have eaten once, naturally do not want to fall twice in the same pit.

** Spiritual Encouragement of Dream Chasing for Team
Self-control does not mean no emotional release. Dream-chasing is one of the most passionate players in the league. When he learns to calm down, he knows more clearly when emotional release will have the greatest positive impact on the team.
In the fourth quarter of the G5 Tianwangshan Battle, the 3-minute dream hit and the roar that lasted for 5-6 seconds made all the warriors, even more than 20,000 spectators of Oracle Stadium, awake when Durant was injured and left the arena in a state of panic.
Yeah, the Warriors lack Durant, but there's still the core team they've been proud of. This spiritual strength prompted the Warriors to regain their focus, including Stephen Curie.
And when Stephen Cooley regains his old bow-and-arrow status, any defensive opponent will feel chilled, and they will try their best to limit Cooley.
Now, Kuri, who has gone through too many tests, is quite calm in the face of this kind of package. He always finds his most trusted dream-chasing Green in various ways.
When Curie attracts the most powerful defensive attention in the past, the Warriors have a great chance to find the loopholes of less defensive opponents in the running of Dreamchase Scheduling.
In the series against Trail Blazers, none of them can really play against Green. Green has a lot of space to play, whether on the offensive side or on the defensive side. His thorough activation and Kuri's hot state, as well as their mutual understanding to the extreme of cooperation, so that the warriors can really become invincible.

Staying healthy and having a calmer mind may be the best dream chase ever seen by Warriors and the league in the past few years.
