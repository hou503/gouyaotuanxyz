Now, more than a month and a half has passed since Durant left the selection basket for the Warriors; 65 days have passed since Kevin Durant broke his Achilles tendon after forcibly returning from G5 in the Finals; and more than half a year has passed since the quarrel between KD and Dreaming Green last November, and the Warriors are doing their best. Now, although the core is still there, it is almost a completely different team from last season, and Kevin Durant chose the Nets after he was injured and went to New York.
At this point, Dream Chasing Green talked about Durant again in an interview with ESPN, and we can easily guess that the topic around Durant should continue to linger around Dream Chasing for a long time.
In fact, Durant also received an interview with Chris Haynes. Of course, he was also asked about dream pursuit. There was something to say about their answers.
When Durant talked about the nonsense of pursuing dreams, he just said, "Damn it! I'm tired of talking about it. We're all adults and professional players. We all understand what this is like... The only difference between me and my former teammates is that I changed different jerseys and nothing else will change.

Or let's take a look at today's version of Dream Pursuit.
"I had a conversation with Durant this summer. In fact, we just talked yesterday," Chasing Dream said. "He's my brother. If someone told me three years ago that he would join the Warriors, win two championships and reach the finals three times in a row, would you accept that? I'm sure I'll be happy. It's a successful experience.
The reporter also asked if Dreamchase had ever known the decision to leave the Warrior in advance from Durant.
"I know Durant's time to go to the basket is the same as everybody else's. It should have been like this. He doesn't have to tell me before he tells everyone that this is our private life.

​
After the storm, until now, Durant went to the basket. Even though he suffered from a broken Achilles tendon, which could almost destroy professional athletes, he still got a four-year top-salary contract.
Chasing Dream did not choose to enter the free market one year or next, but renewed the contract with Warriors in advance this year, which seems to cost Chasing Dream. But in fact, it is also the most salary he can get at present. Five years, 118 million yuan, is reasonable and appropriate.
As a result, Durant has gone to a new team, and the recovery of injuries may be quicker under the advanced medical conditions of the Nets. As long as he stays healthy, the Nets will still be his team, instead of hearing rumors from the Warriors, even though there is no problem between Kury and Durant.

​
Dream-chasing got a big contract as he wished. His first big contract in his career, when the five-year and 85 million-page contract was finalized, Dream-chasing and his mother's video, Dream-chasing mother was very happy when she heard the news of dream-chasing contract renewal.
Dreaming about family hardships in the past has made the contract more meaningful, and their value for money is different from that of a superstar like Durant.
Whether it was such a consideration that the dream chaser finally made the decision of the conflict is unknown, but as a result, the warriors started a new journey and Durant started a new journey. If Durant was not injured, this may be an acceptable situation for everyone.
As Durant said, we are all professional players, professional players for their own best interests, this is the right thing to do.

​
But people didn't realize that in Durant's first season with the Warriors, there was no follow-up to their quarrel. Even after the quarrel, they slept in the same room, and then they made up.
Time can change a lot.

"Everyone pays attention to me, saying I'm a fool, arguing with Cole, arguing with my teammates, banning the finals, and banning the Durant clash, that's probably the most clicked content," this quote in the Dream Pursuit interview was thorough and rational. "But no one wants to know the true content, no one cares about dream chasing is an outstanding and intelligent player, dream chasing is a player who really cares about coaches and teammates, and dream chasing is a person who really cares about winning. Nobody cares about it, because it's not interesting, and what everyone wants to see is that the Golden State Warriors have tasted defeat.
