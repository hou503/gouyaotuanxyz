# The first-round series with the Clippers is decisive for this year's Warriors playoff trip.
Do you remember the first six battles between the Warriors and the Clippers? Do you remember Beverly's remark? Let's first recall.
"I don't think anyone would have expected to play Game 5 or Game 6. People didn't even expect us to be in the playoffs. We want to make some noise. If the warriors really win the championship in the end, you know they have gone through the experience of the Clippers.
That's what Clipper guard Beverly said when the Clippers lost to the Warriors in the Clippers Series. If the warriors really win the championship in the end, you know they have gone through the experience of the Clippers.
In fact, the Clippers'experience of the Warriors, or the battle between the two sides, is decisive for the Warriors' playoff journey in the future.

​
No one thought the Clippers would win the series when they first played the eighth Clippers in the West. In fact, the Warriors did pass, but the way the Warriors passed was so awkward.
In the first round of the playoffs, the Warriors started with five stars at home. Even though Cosins struggled in the first playoff game of his life and eventually got six fouls and left, even though Beverly's close fight led to Durant and his pairs being expelled, the Warriors still won the game without any danger.
In the third quarter of the G2, the Warriors led to 31 points, but in the first quarter of the G2, Cousins'injury, Kury's foul trouble, and the Warriors' carelessness, they sent the players on the bench at the end of the third quarter to practice, which eventually led to a dramatic reversal of 31 points.

​
This dramatic reversal nailed the Warriors to the pillar of humiliation, and they woke up in time from the dream of three consecutive championships. Serious warriors are naturally beyond the Clippers'control. They have won two away games in Los Angeles in succession.
But back at home in G5, a rare full-court playoff game this year, which was blown up by opponents on the offensive side, the Warriors have Durant, have dreams, have Igodara, but they can not prevent opponents, Luwe and Harrel's blockade upset the Warriors'defense area chickens and dogs.
In that series, the Clippers conquered the Warriors'two home courts, which is unthinkable. Oracle Stadium is about to retire this year. The Warriors' bad attitude and their loose defense make Oracle and Warriors fans very embarrassed.
More importantly, the series may have been the trigger for Durant's injury.

# Durant's injuries are related to overconsumption
Why do you say that?
In the first round of the G6, or from the first round of the G3 Clippers began to adjust the defensive strategy for Curie, Durant has begun to carry the whole team.
As usual, Clay started the playoffs slow and hot, one game at a time, while Curie had a good offensive environment in the first two games, and his efficiency in two consecutive games was impressive.
But from the third game, the Clippers team's defensive focus directly all fell on Curie, Curie has also been deeply in foul trouble, Curie's influence on the game declined straight.
The combination of spray and KD tsunami left only Durant, the most stable and peeled off Beverly's interference.
After that, Durant was almost a person holding the attack flag of the Warriors, his upright, his three points, his impact inside the line to create damage, he used all his scoring methods to attack the defensive self-confidence of the other side.
So in G6, Durant scored a playoff career high of 50 points, killing Durant with practical action to verify his "I am Kevin Durant, you know who I am" domineering declaration.
However, the first round of the smooth battle is still beyond everyone's expectations, but also beyond the Warriors'own expectations, 4-0 and 4-1 must be most people predict the series of points.
But the Clippers dragged the game to the sixth game of the series. In the sixth game, Durant slashed 50 points, but Curie and Clay suffered ankle sprains in the game.

​
Then the Golden State Warriors took on their biggest rival in two years, the Houston Rockets.
In this series, two teams fought from beginning to end in each game, and the highest score difference in each of the six matches was not more than 6 points, which is enough to prove the tragic nature of this series.
The Warriors started the series with their injured sparkling brothers, which meant that the team relied more heavily on Kevin Durant in the face of strong opponents.
What's more, the Rockets'own style is for the Warriors. Their infinite room changes and the five death squads corresponding to the Warriors are testing the Warriors' star's success and the ability of the Warriors'singles to score forcibly.
Kuri is still facing the Rockets'G2 finger dislocation, water spray injury let them in the previous few games flat performance, Durant shoulder heavy responsibilities, averaging 30 +, both sides in the first four games to 2-2 draw.
Then in the fifth Tianwangshan battle, Durant pulled up his right calf when he landed on a non-confrontational jump shot in an attack.
Durant went back to see if anyone had fallen the first time after he was injured. He thought he had stepped on someone's foot, but he didn't. The injury came in a strange way, but it was not without reason.

​
Durant came to the Warriors in the past few seasons, their strong strength so that they rarely experienced a continuous test throughout the playoffs, the remaining warriors have been under the leadership of Clay Dream to win the Rockets series, the lack of Durant, they have also been a succession of strong enemies.
But they have never been in a struggle since the first round of the playoffs. This year's first round warriors did not win the series once again, the Clippers'six matches, and the Rockets' four super-high-intensity confrontations, or Durant was not a strong body collapsed.

# The pioneers of the remnants made the warriors too confident. On the stage of the finals, the warriors were punished.
The moment Durant left the field injured was probably what most fans thought was the end of the Warrior Dynasty.
But Stephen Cooley refused to agree. Cooley, who had been depressed for a long time, finally saved his life in the G5. In the second half of the G6 match, he slashed 33 points to save the storm and put the Warriors on the stage of the Western Conference finals.
In the West Final, the Warriors played against the Portland Trailblazers, who were equally defeated.
Trailblazers are reimbursed by power center Nurkich before the playoff season begins. With their excellent double-shot performance, they will go all the way back and win Thunder and Nuggets to the West.
But the Warriors may be one of the most knowledgeable teams to open up the Pioneers. The Shuihua Brothers have obvious advantages in the face of double-shot, and the Warriors'front line gives more support to the team.

​
In the series against Trail Blazers, the Warriors lost more time than they won, but every time the Warriors'Jedi counterattack, they even the score instantly and even exceeded the score. Winning conceals too many problems.
In fact, the most lethal problem of the Warriors this year is defense, which has been exposed in the long regular season of the Warriors. In the past few years, the defensive efficiency of the Warriors in the regular season ranked in the top ten of the league, and in good times ranked in the top five of the league. But this year, defensive problems have become the direct cause of the Warriors'repeated collapses.
Defense problems also make the Warriors lose when facing the league's strong teams. It is no longer the style of the league's strong teams a few years ago. Even in the face of the rotten tank team, the Warriors also lost a big score or even suffered a terrible defeat at the home court. This is really a problem.
Kuri's high level of play, the warriors'counter-attack to the pioneers of the Western Decision finally swept the end, and the pioneers' defense in fact did not create any trouble for the warriors, 4-0 sweep brings the confidence of the players is also full.

​
Only in the face of this season's top defensive Raptors, playoff defensive efficiency League second Raptors, the Warriors in the Finals stage to eat the punishment.
The five positions of the Raptors'individual defense and coordinated defense echoes belong to the top of the league. Lorry's offensive fouls, Danny Green's soldier stickers, DPOY's small cards and Siakam's height and arm length, as well as DPOY's small additions, these five people's first defensive ability can be called explosive watch.
When the Warriors came up against the Raptors of this level, their attacks were blocked continuously. So far, they have played their best wave in the G2 in four matches, but after the G2, even the Warriors were dominated by the Raptors after the third quarter.
Today's G4 game, the Raptors are in Oracle Stadium, in the Warriors'favorite third quarter of the anti-tourists as the main force, and eventually lay the winning game.

Speaking of it, without the excessive consumption of the first round, without the previous downturn of Clarkuri, there would be no excessive consumption of Durant, and if Durant was not injured, the warriors would not at least fall into such a desperate situation as they are now.
The experience of the Clipper Fleet, as Beverly put it, has not yet alerted the warriors thoroughly, but the pressure and consumption that the Clipper Fleet exerted on the Warriors may be the last straw for the Warrior Dynasty to end the crushing of camels.
