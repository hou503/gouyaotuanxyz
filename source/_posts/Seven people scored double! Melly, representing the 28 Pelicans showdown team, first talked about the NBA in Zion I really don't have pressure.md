At the end of today's pre-season game, the Pelican won four consecutive games with 123-114 Rick Spurs away. Yes, the pelican got Ingram and Bauer in the Davis deal this summer, and the presence of the two leaders strengthened the talent of the pelican. Plus the pelican took Zion Williams with the first prize tag.
It's an emperor star with James's tough body and O'Neill's average weight. In previous preseason games, it was a perfect demonstration of dominance for everyone.
In the last game, Zion broke the league's first defense against Utah, Gerber, and scored five goals in six rounds against him. Today, facing the hot Spurs, Popovich has nothing to do with him.

Zion's performance in the third quarter shattered the Spurs. Because the Spurs felt so good in the first half today, Forbes incarnated in Kuri in the first quarter, first hitting 3 + 1, then hitting a difficult three-point goal. Spurs are in full bloom in the first quarter under three minutes of rain. The Pelican side only relies on Holiday and Zion to maintain the score difference, with the Spurs leading the Pelican by 11 points in the first quarter.
In the second quarter, the Spurs kept on scoring and Ingram responded. The two sides were caught in a tug-of-war, and the Spurs continued to lead by 10 points at 66-56 at half-time. But we all know that the first fat is not fat, the Spurs attack is not hot the whole game.
In the second half, the pelican finally offered a trump card killing. The delicate connection between Zion and Bauer made the pelican blow a counter-attack horn like mercury.

Zion received many shots from Bauer under the basket. Although he was less than 2 meters tall, he weighed 129 kilograms horribly. Under the basket, Zion turned around and buttocked, and the defender could not stop it. Zion is like Shaquille O'Neal who used to give Popovich a headache. By virtue of his excellent physical qualities, he caused frequent killings in the interior.
In the middle of the third section, Zion also comes with an empty button with a leaky side. The Pelican has equalized the 10-point difference. However, Zion was still reluctant and scored another four points under the Spurs basket.
The pelican, led by Zion, fired a 16-2 attack wave, but the Spurs were nine points behind at the end of the third quarter.

The Spurs'morale is not in the fourth quarter. Pelican side Moore, Jackson and Walker fight more bravely. Popovich wielded all his troops and won four consecutive victories. The Pelican seems to be losing Davis's strength, but it's getting stronger and stronger. The seven pelicans scored double in the game. They are hopeful to be in the playoffs next season, and Zion, a strong team in the West, has changed everything.
Perhaps Zion, like James and Duncan, will be at its peak when it comes out, and then it will be at its peak for more than a decade. Today, Zion fought for 30 minutes at 8 in 11, with 22 points and 10 board support. The team's boss Hollerdy also cut 16 points, Walker 13 points, Bauer 12 points and Ingram 10 points.

Nicole Melly, who spoke to the media after the game, talked about the current pelican. Merry thinks Zion is the first weapon of the pelican, and others under his leadership have fully demonstrated their strength. Speaking about the League situation, Melly believes they will shock the other 28 teams next season.
Why 28 teams? Because one team has been removed, the other 29 teams are innocent.

It is worth mentioning that Zion also talked about his performance in the NBA pre-season after the game, including the Spurs today. A reporter asked Zion, do you think the NBA League will put pressure on you?
"Ah, pressure? I haven't felt too much pressure in these preseasons, including today's Spurs. I just learn from the experience of the game, enjoy it and try to win it! "
Horizontal ah, it's too horizontal. To tell you the truth, James may not be as good as Zion in terms of strength and physical confrontation alone. Because Ziontai is so strong. It weighs 129 kilograms and has such speed and explosive power.

James gained weight during the heat but suffered minor injuries, while Zion's weight did not seem to have much impact on him at the moment.
According to a famous comment on Zion on the internet: "There will be no pressure in my life. My opponent weighs less than me, jumps less than me, and has less money than me. What pressure can I have?"
