In these three games, the Lakers have three things in common. First, James has three doubles. Second, Kuzma is back. Third, Howard has played 12 minutes in the last game. In the end, the Lakers have all reversed.

In the game with the bulls, Vogel continued the pattern of the first two games, let Kuzma go up first and partner with bushmei. Although we all know that Howard's effect is much better, in order to let Kuzma integrate into the game and slowly adapt to the rhythm of the game, Vogel still risked a lot of playing time for Kuzma, let him find the rhythm, to establish contact with bushmei ã€‚
As in the first two games, the Lakers' starting line-up is in a hole. Kutz was not good after coming. He had no hand feeling. He couldn't find his own position. He also made mistakes. The Lakers didn't defend, and the offensive end was in a state of stagnation. He was once beaten under pressure.

Howard didn't do much after coming up in the second quarter. It's not for Howard's personal reasons, it's for the Lakers. First of all, the Lakers frequently make mistakes in the offensive end, tactical confusion, no positional warfare, almost all turn back running. Howard even has difficulty in passing the ball and even touching the ball. Secondly, the defense of his teammates was a bit bad. Howard wiped his teammates' buttocks for many times under the basket, so he had two fouls early, and he also played very hard. From Howard's performance, he felt angry for his failure to defend his opponent. It can be seen that he has a high demand for himself. The game is very competitive and hard-working. This desire to win is what we want to see and what the Lakers lack.
Howard played 9 minutes in the second quarter of the game, without any data, 0 shots, 0 rebounds, 0 assists, 0 steals, 0 blocks, just like he didn't play, but the positive and negative values were - 13. Howard played only three minutes in the third quarter, helping the team chase points with James.

The real turning point in the fourth quarter, led by Kuzma to a wave of offensive climax, the Lakers played a wave of 16-0, of which Howard's credit is not small. In this game, Howard played 12 minutes, 4-for-3, got 6 points, 5 rebounds and 1 block, with a positive and negative value of + 19 in a single quarter. When the Lakers entered the fourth quarter, they were 13 points behind. When James came back, Howard and Kuzma had already reversed the score by more than 1 point, and the momentum of the game had been reversed.
Howard's contributions include scoring the second attack after grabbing the rebounds in the front court, getting the card under the basket and receiving the pass from his teammates, James playing the singles on one side, Howard waiting for the chance to run and receive the ball and lay up. It can be seen that Howard doesn't care about the ball right, but he has been looking for opportunities and is very positive. This is due to more than ten years of experience in the game, which can not be practiced overnight.

Howard's defense is the fundamental reason for the Lakers to win the game. It's also the reason for the Lakers to win three consecutive away games, or even the latest six consecutive wins.
The game 9:40 seconds, the Lakers behind 6 points, Kuzma missed the penalty basket, Howard grabbed the rebound to play 2 points. Looking back, bulls guard white didn't play a single against Kuzma, but went to Howard to play again, which was the most wrong decision he made in this game. Howard has been defending in front of white from the three-point line without losing his position. When he rushed to the restricted area for layup, Howard directly gave him a big cap and fanned out the bottom line. White then made another three-point Miss against Howard's defense. Before the end, the Lakers fought back. Howard wanted to be in the position under the basket. Cook gave the ball quickly. Howard played a 2 + 1. These two attacks and one defense directly broke the bull at both ends of the attack and defense and dominated the interior line!
If we don't have Howard's defense, the Lakers may be able to win by James. But with Howard's defense, the Lakers can fight back much more efficiently. The most important thing is that Howard's defense performance can inspire teammates to take out the best defense attitude, form an atmosphere, and change the atmosphere. There are only people in the Lakers Howard.

Looking back on the off-season, Howard accepted the Lakers' non guaranteed base salary contract with the lowest attitude, which was questioned and criticized by many fans. Now it seems that the Lakers really found the treasure, don't worry about any of his problems, or even seamless connection with James and bushmei on the court. Therefore, the Lakers fans gave Howard a nickname: Huo Zhenxiang!
According to reports after the game, Howard went to practice again after the game. A player's attitude can really determine a lot of things.
