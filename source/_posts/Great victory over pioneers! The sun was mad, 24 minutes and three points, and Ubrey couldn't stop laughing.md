At the end of today's pre-season, the Suns beat the Blazers 134-118 away. The performance of the Suns in this match is very impressive, because today Buck and Eton and Rubio are all absent, but the Suns are playing like a tiger, using the remnants to face the Blazers three quarters to punch out.
From the beginning of the first quarter, the sun showed his desire to attack. Ubray was the first soldier. He attacked the Blazers in a row and scored four points in a row. Baines also hit three points, followed by Baines and Ubrey play a duet, a blockbuster assault and get two points.
Under the impact of Ubrey and Baines, the Sun started 16-6.

Of course, the pioneers did not wait to die. Betsmore and Lillard scored 8 points in a row, the Blazers responded 8-0, and the Blazers were one point ahead in the first quarter. But in the second quarter, the sun rose again, Sharich was unstoppable, the sun hit a wave of 11-2, the difference will be directly opened to 11 points.
The Blazers were still 58-65 down in the first half, and the Suns continued to attack in the second half. Three-thirds of a million arrows, Kaminski hit in a row. The Sun blossomed the game in the third quarter, and the two sides began to change their main players in the last quarter.
The Suns showed horrible teamwork and seven of them scored double. Ubrey scored 19 points, 3 rebounds and 1 assistant in 5 of 11 shots, of which 3 were from 5 of 3-point shots.

Today's Aubrey really carried the team and became the leader. Other teammates Bridges scored 13 points, Sharich 13 points, Baines 14 points, Kaminski 16 points, Cameron Johnson 18 points, 2 rebounds and 1 board assists, Taylor Johnson 18 points.
The Suns shot 24 of the 45 points in the game, 24 of which hit three points, breaking the team's record, this is the pre-season regular season and the playoffs, the Suns hit the most three points in a single game.
The pioneers scored 18 points for Lillard and 27 for McLemo, but the crazy sun was hard to stop.

The Suns'current squad is really weak, and they should not go to pieces next season. Because the team's strength and talent are enough, there is no need to rebuild by putting it on the back burner. Buck can go to the point guard, he has a qualified passing master, Rubio can join the team.
In addition, the top runner up, Ron Aton, also grew up last season. As a flank, Aubrey also showed the potential of an all star. The Suns deserve to play in the playoffs. They have the strength to prove themselves in the West, not to remain silent.

As we all know last season, the league is boycotting the pendulum and Zion Williams was picked by the pelican. The Pelican gets the champion's ticket, in fact, to a certain extent, it is punishing those squandered teams. Now the Sun should wake up like a dream. For Ubrey, next season is a good time for him to explode.
It's just that for pioneers, today's failure is frustrating. Lillard apologized publicly when he talked about defeat after the game. He thought the team's performance was very bad, including him, and could not bring it to the regular season.

Lillard said: "Today is a terrible game, compared to last season we started to rust. We need to increase communication, including me, which is not very good today. In addition, there are defensive exchanges, as well as protection of the ball. I know it's just a pre-season without fuss, but we still need to do better.
