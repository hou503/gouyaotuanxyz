Primary school students all know the importance of the certificate, which is the substantive performance of the award they receive, and also something that can be made public.
In the NBA, there are many similar "certificates" and the most important is the six awards: championship, finals MVP, regular season MVP, best defensive player, All-Star MVP and best rookie award.
For example, the best defensive team, the best lineup, and the All-Star selection, these are the honors of the players, but will not appear in the trophies and awards.
And seasonal data such as scoring champion and rebounding champion will not show. Although All-Star dunk champion or skill champion has trophies, their influence on the whole career is limited.
So based on these six awards, we can see which gods in history have won the cup soft?

Fifth place, Kobe Bryant, 12 trophies
Kobe Bryant has won five championships in his career. Although the first three FMVPs were won by O'Neill, the absolute core of the team at that time, Kobe Bryant undoubtedly won the award of FMVP in the last two consecutive championships.
Although Kobe has entered the best defensive lineup many times in his career, it is not easy for defenders to get the best defensive players. Kobe failed to get DPOY in the end.
But Kobe has won only one MVP award in his entire career, which may be surprising, but it also proves the value of MVP. Even better than Kobe, he may not get MVP in an unsuitable season. After all, MVP needs to consider the influence of data and record comprehensively. However, Bryant's All-Star MVP number can be quite a lot, a total of four times, ranking first in history.
Together, Bryant's six Career Awards totaled 12 trophies.

​
Fourth place, Duncan, 12 trophies
Duncan's career was also five champions, but Duncan won three of the Finals MVP, and Duncan won the MVP awards in 2002 and 2003.
Similar to Kobe, Duncan has not won DPOY awards in his career although he has been selected for defense for a while. However, Duncan's advantage over Kobe is that in the rookie season, Duncan has been selected for a couple of seasons and has naturally won the best rookie without any doubt.
Duncan has only one All-Star MVP in his career, but Duncan's style is not suitable for all-Star stage, and it's good to get one.
Together, Duncan's six Career Awards have won 12 trophies, just like Kobe's.

Third place, Magician, 13 trophies
Magic's rookie season has already shocked the league. In rookie season, he rushed to the finals and became a center and eventually won FMVP. But most curiously, in the competition with Larry Bird's best rookie, Magic failed to compete and finally lost the best rookie trophy.
However, five championships and three FMVPs are still solid awards. In the fierce competition in the 1980s, magicians have won three MVPs, and All-Star MVPs have won two, quite fierce.
Six awards for magician's career totaled 13 trophies.

​
Second place, LeBron James, 14 trophies
LeBron James's entire career is at its peak, the best performance in more than a decade.
Although the three championships are not much compared with other big gods, FMVP in the three finals is not much compared with other players. James's advantage lies in the regular season MVP. He has won four championships altogether, even within five years.
James also won three All-Star MVPs in his career, ranking second in history. He also won the best rookie, and the total number of trophies came to 14, ranking second in history.

​
First place, Michael Jordan, 22 trophies
God's dominance, whether in the field of competition, data or honor statistics, is full of dominance. In the ranking of trophies, Jordan still dominates by a huge advantage.
The best rookie still has no doubt. Jordan's rookie season was 28.2 points, which is quite exaggerated; Jordan's career has won three All-Star MVPs; the conventional MVP has won five.
Jordan is also the only defender who has won the best defensive player in history. More importantly, the first person in Jordan's history is Jordan's six finals, six Championships and six FMVP honors.

Coupled with these trophies, Jordan's career trophies totaled 22, leading James in the second place by up to 8, and the God of basketball deserves to be the God of basketball.
