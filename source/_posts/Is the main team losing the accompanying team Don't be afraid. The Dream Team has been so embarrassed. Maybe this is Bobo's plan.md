Today's news about the American men's basketball team is quite interesting. According to the basketball logo Sam Amick, the source disclosed that the American men's basketball team lost to the accompanying team twice in today's match.
The team is made up of Development League players and NBA edge players. There are also Rocket youngsters who used to make "end-of-the-urinal" free throws by Onouaku. But this team, under the leadership of Jeff Van Gundy, won two straight matches of the American men's basketball team.

Of course, the game is not a regular 48 minutes, but 10 minutes per game. The American men's basketball team lost 3 points to the accompanying team in the first game and 19 points in the second game. The total score of the second game is 17-36.
It is reasonable to say that although the major players of the American Men's Basketball Team left the team during this training camp, either preparing for the new season or resting, the remaining team of the American Men's Basketball Team is talented enough and strong enough, but the results of the match are really so striking.

Most of the remaining 14 players in the U.S. Men's Basketball Training Camp are the core starters or potential core of each team, including Fox, Mitchell, Tatum, Kuzma and other league upstarts, but such a team can not guarantee to play against a team of Development League players and NBA marginal players. When a team is formed, it wins.
The loss of the main team to the accompanying team, which happened to NBA players, should be ashamed or humiliated, but in the United States Men's Basketball World Cup preparation stage, at this point in time, this kind of loss seems to have some other meaning.
It is also easy to recall the experience of the Dream Team that shocked the whole world.

Yeah, it's the historical team made up of Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, Scott Pippen, Carl Malone, David Robinson and other NBA superstars. It's the team that bled the whole basketball world at the 1992 Olympic Games. It's called the Dream Team. Teams have had similar experiences.
In 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games, the Dream Team won eight games, with an average score of 117.3 points per game and an average net victory of 43.8 points per game. It won the gold medal in an invincible manner, which made the world feel the top charm of American professional basketball.
But such a dream team still lost to a team of American college students before leaving for Barcelona.

Of course, there are also Chris Weber, who later made his mark in the NBA, Penny Hadaway and Grant Hill, but in any case, the star of this team is almost no more than that of the Dream Team.
Nevertheless, the first contest between Dream Team I and this college students'accompanying team is still the victory of the college students' accompanying team.
Later, the Dream Team coach, Chuck Daley, claimed that he arranged the game to make the Dream Team players understand that losing is also possible.
Such a truth is still applicable to today's U.S. team. Even without a lot of star flavor, the strength of the United States is still ahead of any opponent in the World Cup. Under such circumstances, they must understand that pride may be the biggest opponent.

The Dream Team I had been "embarrassed" before the expedition. It seems that the defeat of this match is not unacceptable. Maybe it is just the "old skill" of Master Zhuge Popovich.
