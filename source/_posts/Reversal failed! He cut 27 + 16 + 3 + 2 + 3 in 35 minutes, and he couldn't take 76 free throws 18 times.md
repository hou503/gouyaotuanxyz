The 76ers continued their journey away from home. This time, they challenged the jazz of the western strong team, and ebbed was back. He was the core player who helped the 76ers to regain their momentum. Jazz lost to Clippers in the last game, but Mitchell scored high and got better and better, while Conley's state is still a ticking bomb. Whether he plays well or not has a lot to do with the trend of the game.

In the first quarter of the game, ebbed was caught holding the ball in the first round, showing the focus and intensity of jazz defense. Ebbed had a lot of ball rights in the start, but he was the best defensive player himself, and there were still people in the low post, so ebbed didn't get a good mobile conference. The Jazz started with Conley's attack, but the effect was not very good. Mitchell took over the ball right later. He shot four times for four shots, three of which were shot in the middle simply with the help of cover, and ebbed stayed in the three second zone, basically unable to come out.
In the rotation stage, the Jazz first replaced Mitchell, who was in good condition, and let Conley lead the team. When Mitchell came back in the last three minutes, the 76 man netto strengthened the defense around Mitchell, which was very effective for Mitchell's entanglement. In the face of netto, Mitchell missed three shots. The 76ers found their hand outside the three-point line and scored three three-point goals, surpassing the score in one fell swoop. After the first battle, the 76ers and the Jazz fought 29-26.

In the next quarter, the Jazz beat gobel, Bradley played against ebbed. Obviously, the 76ers had the upper hand in all aspects, so the 76ers played almost every round with ebbed. When ebbed was in the low post and deep inside, the Jazz couldn't defend him, but there was a problem in the outside line. Moreover, after ebbed played four rounds in a row, he was frantically entrapped by the Jazz team. Harris was idle as an offensive strength. There was a problem in the attack of the 76ers. Braun replaced ebbed in the next round.
Harris regained the ball right after a cool period of time, but the hit rate was very low. On the contrary, the 76 players were bombed continuously by Bogdanovic and gobel because they did not have embid in the interior, and the two teams drew 46. In the second half of the game, Simmons didn't play because of a shoulder injury, and ebbed led the bench alone. There was no hofford or Harris, but he was in a sawing position with the jazz. At the end of half-time, the two sides were 56-58, and the 76ers were 2 points behind.

In the third quarter, without Simmons, the attack of the 76ers was a little simple. Harris still didn't find his hand. There was not much chance for enbid. Hofford couldn't make it in four consecutive rounds, and the 76ers fell into the scoring shortage. Mitchell played aggressively and hit a high percentage on the Jazz side. Conley also found the form. He had three-point shooting on the outside and three-point shooting on the inside. In half a quarter, the Jazz pulled the difference to 11 points.
In the second half of the third quarter, ebbed came back to lead the substitutes, but the attacking end of the 76ers was not good. First of all, ebbed played very simply, facing gobel's defensive shooting from a long distance, or holding the ball at a low position was sandwiched. Jazz's defense caused great trouble to the 76ers, because they didn't have the guard like Simmons to handle the ball and create opportunities, although Richardson And netted two non chance three-point goals, but the difference at the end of the three quarters was stabilized at 11 points.

At the end of the game, Harris strengthened his personal attack, although the efficiency was not particularly high, but at least recovered some feelings. He scored 10 points in a row to help the 76ers get close to the score, but when the Jazz team gobel came back, Harris would be a little difficult to attack the inside line again. Moreover, after enbid came back, the attack power of the 76ers concentrated on him, and Harris got more opportunities It's hard.
In the last five minutes of the last quarter, ebbed finally scored in the second half. It was difficult to get two chances in the small circle of the forbidden area. When Mitchell came up from the Jazz side, he didn't score twice in a row. Conley couldn't score, and the difference was reduced to 4 points. At the last critical moment, Mitchell missed two shots, but the 76ers failed to seize the chance, and Richardson's one mistake directly ruined the game.

In the whole game, the two sides played 106-104. Gobel was sent off for six fouls. He got 14 + 16 + 3 + 3 for 4 of 8 shots. Harris, Horford and enbid didn't play well because of the interference of gobel in the interior line and good defense. Conley found the form in this game, although the hit rate is not high, 15 points, but plus or minus + 19. Mitchell played well in the first three quarters. In the fourth quarter, the hand fell and the whole game got 24 + 5 + 8. The reason why Jazz can win is the overall defense and team attack.
76 people because of Simon's injury, leading to the team's organizational offensive play is very bad, in the connection of the game there are a lot of offensive problems. Hofford scored only 7 points in 4 of 13. Embid played 35 minutes, 5 of 16 shots, 1 of 3-pointers, 5 of 5. The hit rate was very low, but he missed 18 times, got 27 points, 16 rebounds, 3 assists, 2 blocks and 3 mistakes. He lost in the first game since he came back. It was very difficult for embid and Simmons to win if they left.
