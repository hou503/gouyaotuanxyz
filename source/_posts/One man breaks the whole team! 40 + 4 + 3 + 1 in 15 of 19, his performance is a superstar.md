In the first quarter, sun made three mistakes at the beginning of the game, two of which were tackled by Simmons to complete the counterattack, one of which was directly hit on the backboard and then hit back. Harris played inside and outside in a row, and the attack and defense of 76 players at the beginning of the game were very aggressive. But the sun's own offensive state is very good, ebbed is not in, Baines dominates the 76 people's inner line, both prevented Simmons, and 3-for-3, got 7 points, Booker and ubre are also in good condition, on the contrary, the 76 people are behind in the score.

In the next quarter, after Rubio came back, the Suns played more organizationally in the offensive end. When Aubrey and Booker came back, they played very well in tactics and kept aggressive in the offensive end. Suns Baines can't defend, the 76 man shooting type inside got a lot of opportunities, so the score still can't open.
But after Baines goes down, the sun's interior line has no height, and the rebounds are continuously exploded. In the second half of the period, 76 people, by virtue of their height advantage, continuously hit the front rebounds and got a lot of second attack opportunities. The sun has no choice but to replace Baines. Although the attack end has a little effect, it's his own 2 points to let the other side get 4 points. He can only defend under the interior basket, a little bit It's hard to be a little far away. In the last 3.9 seconds, the 76ers took a three-point lead to six with hofford's pressure post, and the two sides played 61-55.

In the third quarter, the Suns were relatively lax in defense, making the 76ers' tactics too easy to play, but also to be robbed. Fortunately, Booker came out, scored 9 points in a row, and was sent a three-point ball to assist. Under his series and scoring leadership, and even under the defensive enthusiasm, the Suns kept the momentum of chasing points, barely making up for the disadvantage of the defensive end.
In the last four minutes, Booker led a wave of attack climax, even scoring five points to level the score, but the Suns had a problem. Baines and Booker got their fourth foul in two rounds, and had to leave early. The Suns put five substitutes on the court, while the 76ers had Simmons, hofford, Ennis and Harris, but the array Rong didn't play as well as he did in the first half, but was caught by the Suns' substitutes. The Suns once surpassed 76. At the end of the third quarter, the 76ers led the Suns 82-81 by one point.

After the pause, Horford made a continuous effort to equalise the score in a short time.
