# What is the home advantage?
The Blazers and Thunder series are now back in Oklahoma, home to the Thunder. In the NBA, there is a saying that has been circulating for a long time, the series began to win away.
Even with a 2-0 lead, if the Blazers don't win at home, the series will continue to drag on.
After returning to Thunder's home court, the Thunder team's performance has changed dramatically from the previous two games. The most subjective point is that in the first two games, the Thunder made a total of three-point shots, making 10 of 61 shots, with a shooting percentage of only 16.4%.
In this game, the Thunder team shot 15 of 29 shots from the three-point line, and the shooting percentage was close to 50%. This difference is quite huge.

Why is it that returning to the home Thunder team is like changing a team? Even Weishao's depressed hand feel has ushered in an outbreak.
In the home game, the pressure of role players will be well shouldered by the fans on the spot. When players score goals, the cheers of fans on the spot will give them more confidence. This is the so-called home advantage.
Character players will play better at home, which is very important for the home team.
Players like Weishao, his goal and the release of his emotions after his goal, as well as his interaction as team leader and fans on the spot, all of these will stimulate the spirit of the whole team.
Although this spirit can not be touched and quantified, its function is real.
The so-called momentum represents morale and power in competitive sports.
If the team is united and powerful, it will be ambitious and vigorous, like the wind, like the thunder, and overwhelm the enemy, which is called momentum.
Especially in the 0-2 backwardness, has retreated the irreversible stall, the Thunder team died and then came into being.
Pressure at this time, because the home fans cheer and strong support has been removed a lot, without too heavy pressure, players can more freely play their original strength.

​
For example, the first two games were Grant 8-1 and 7-2, respectively. Today, 4-5 shots from the three-point line continued the much-needed firepower for the Thunder team. For example, Ferguson, who made 3-3 shots from 9-3 in the first two games, also made 3-4 shots from outside the three-point line today, and still made three fouls in the first quarter of the game. The young players withstood it. Pressure helps the team.
And today's Schroeder, according to the body of Schroeder, as long as he plays in the playoffs, he will definitely be the target of opponents, but today, Schroeder not only played a good defensive performance, but also showed his value in the offensive side.
In the fourth quarter, he helped the Thunder to survive the most dangerous period of time by making blocked mid-shots and killing. Schroeder scored 17 points in 5 of 11. In addition, he also had 5 rebounds, 6 assists and 2 steals, which showed amazing performance.

# Few Jedi survive
The role players are divided by three points, and the Thunder team needs the core players to show their authority. Otherwise, only George, who made three of 16 shots in this game, the Thunder's game situation is quite dangerous.
In this vital game, Westbrook came out. Weishao's feeling is basically a barometer of the Thunder Team.
In the first half of the match, the thunder and the pioneers were in a stalemate. Here we have to mention Thunder's double-shot defense in this game.
With the strength of two shots, of course, it is impossible to be completely restricted by the defense, but the Thunder started well.
They asked George and Grant to play against Lillard or CJ McCollem, respectively. After the opening of the game, several shots of the two guns were out of line, which played a role.
In addition, Thunder's response to the pioneers'previous attempts to block and disassemble attacks was to let the defending double-gun players directly bypass the cover, instead of simply exposing the slow-moving Adams to the skilled double-gun.
Thunderstorm can keep the situation in check until the shooter's rhythm is suppressed at the beginning.
At the beginning of the third quarter, the Thunder Team began to rise, relying on the play of both the Thunder and the Less Thunder.
Weishao assisted George's 3+1, followed by Weishao's super bloodcap against Lillard, as well as Weishao's back singles Lillard 2+1 and the subsequent cradle Baby action, these scores and emotional release let the Chesapeake Energy Stadium fully activated.
This is the beginning of the thunderstorm. When momentum rose, Thunder immediately held a lead of about 10 points.
In the fourth quarter, Weishao's several surprising three-point long shots were the final conclusion of the game.
Strangely enough, the pioneers in the first two matches who completely let go of the three points are choosing to go forward and take precautions today. On the contrary, after being put on defense, the three-point power loss seems to have found the sight, and the more the shot, the more accurate it is.
And when Wilson's three-point sense of touch returns, his threat of attack returns.

# CJ, which still feels good, and Lillard, which goes all the way to the extreme.
Two guns are the core of the pioneers. Even on Thunder's away ground, they are still not disappointing. The Blazers'weakness in this game is still above the so-called role players.
On the road, the support given by the role players to the core players is significantly reduced. But CJ is stable enough, smart enough, and Lillard is horizontal enough.
CJ's defense against George or Grant in this game has a fairly normal feel, but his smartest thing is to know when to shoot.
CJ catches up with the Thunder Team during the link-up period, and steals three points from the Thunder Team's defensive foot. The effect is quite good.
The third quarter of Lillard, as if killing God, if not for the third quarter of the Thunder outside three-point feel also maintained at a fairly high level, the Thunder team may be the third quarter of a 25-point Lillard alone.
The third section in the rhythm of Lillard, whether it is the three-point break-up, or the strong layup after crossing the folder, basically not lost, one person supported the attack of the whole team. At the same time, it can also cause great defensive attraction while striving for easy scoring opportunities for teammates, which is the strength of super point guard.
Of course, it was Lillard who broke his rhythm in the fourth quarter that failed to continue the fire. On the other side, Mayor was in high spirits, and the game was over.

Now the Thunder home court pulls back a city, the big score is 1-2, the Thunder is still passive, they still have to guard their home court.
And the most interesting thing is that in these matches, Lillard and Wilson have been completely confronted, and the resentment between the two naturally need not be mentioned in the past, who are not satisfied with anyone, the stadium is also the main killer.
So this series, from the point of view of the fans, of course, the more you play, the better.
