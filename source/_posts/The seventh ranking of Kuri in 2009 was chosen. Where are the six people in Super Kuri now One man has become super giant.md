Stephen Curry is naturally the hottest player in the League today. His three points and the trend of small balls sweeping the League based on his three points have had a great impact on the league's basketball today.
Curie has also grown from the "Glass Man" who first entered the League to the first point guard in the League today, and is also the winner of two MVPs and three championships. Even if he ends his career with his current honor, Curie is qualified to hit the top of the history guard list.
But we also know that although Curie made a sensation in the United States during his college years, the "Mad Trip" in 2008 made Curie's name famous for the first time in the country. At that time, Curie did not enter the NBA. But when he really came to the NBA and came to the draft convention, Kury didn't get too much favor, or he didn't get enough attention to match his fame in college. At the draft convention, Kury was chosen in the 7th place.

​
In fact, the situation of the six players before Curie at the 2009 draft was quite different. Some have become MVP players, able to sit on a par with Curie, and others have disappeared from the league. Let's see.
The sixth-ranking player in 2009 was Timberwolves'guard Johnny Flynn, the fifth-ranking player, and Timberwolves' guard Ricky Rubio. This is interesting. Timberwolves chose defenders in two consecutive rankings before Curie, but did not consider Curie.

​
In fact, Flynn was regarded as instant power by Timberwolves. Flynn averaged 13.5 points and 4.4 assists in the rookie season. He did well in theory, but his shooting percentage was low and his efficiency was low. Only one season later, he was traded by Timberwolves and disappeared quickly in the league.
The Timberwolves have more hope for a younger and more promising Rubio, who did not enter the League until the 2011-12 season, but in his first season, Rubio showed great possession and organizational talent, averaging 10.6 points, 4.2 rebounds and 8.2 assists. However, what troubled Rubio's whole career was his shooting problems, which led him to be abandoned by the Timberwolves, and the same outcome was repeated by the Jazz.

​
Fourth place Evans, rookie season is also able to match the existence of God, he is the fourth rookie season in the history of the League to play 20 + 5 + 5 players, the previous three, respectively, O, Jordan and James.
Such a starting point means that Evans has an unlimited future, but the King's confusion and the team's confusion about Evans'positioning make Evans seem to have embarked on the "injury Zhongyong" road, and now it is because the drug incident has been banned by the League directly, even the idea of playing in China. For now, he looks forward to playing in the future. The possibility of returning to the alliance will continue to decline.

​
Thirdly, Harden, the first point guard in the League today, grew from a substitute in the Thunder era to a scoring machine with an average of 36.1 points per game last season. Although he failed to break through in the playoffs, his current position is enough to be equal to Curie.
The second highest ranking in 2009 was Grizzlies'Hashem Tabbit, an unknown top scorer who scored an average of 3.1 points a season in rookie season. No wonder it has long been forgotten. Historically, there have been a lot of players who have had problems signing at the top of the list. At least in 2009, the water level has been particularly high.

​
The champion of 2009 belongs to Griffin. Although Griffin was injured for one year, he rose rapidly in the 10-11 rookie season and in the following years. Violent dunking became his symbol.
But the Clippers'time did not help Griffin to become a better player, but was traded to the Pistons, Griffin's mentality finally changed, this year's playoffs with injuries, it seems that people see a different Griffin.

Who could have imagined that the 7th ranking, light-skinned and even unlike the black Curie, could grow into the first point guard in the League today, and the first point guard and the first point guard were released in the 09th session. Even if rearranged, Curie and Harden would definitely occupy the top two positions.
