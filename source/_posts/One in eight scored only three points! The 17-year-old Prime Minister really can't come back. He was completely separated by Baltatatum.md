At the end of today's pre-season game, the Magic defeated the Celtics 75-100 at home. The magic was shattered from the first quarter, with a score of 21-2. The huge gap between Magic and Celtics is somewhat elusive.
Because last season magic at least also made the playoffs, but this season although it is the pre-season magic seems to return to the same way. On the court, the players were listless and rowed freely.

If the regular season starts in this state, Magic will probably miss the playoffs again this year. After all, the Eastern Conference is not competitive, but it is not a casual playoff.
In addition, today's top player in 17 years, Ron fultz, undoubtedly played a not very good game. Fultz came on as a substitute for 21 minutes and only got 3 points, 1 rebound, 4 assists and 1 steal in 8 shots. There are many videos about Fultz this summer. Some American media think Fultz got his shooting bag back.
But judging from the recent situation of the game, fultz still has some problems in shooting.

In college, Fultz shot very elegant, all kinds of beautiful shots. But now Fultz's shot is a bit late, a bit like a push shot. It seems to be similar to the previous season's brother Bauer. This is definitely not the type of shooter Fultz used to shoot in college.
It can only be said that Fultz's strange illness almost ruined his career, it is worth mentioning that in the last spurs. Fultz played 17 minutes, 8 shots 3, 6 points 2 rebounds 4 assists 2 steals.
He seems to have changed from the pride of the past to a qualified substitute. After the game, fultz also reflected publicly. He thought that his performance was not very good or he could not integrate into the game.

Furtz said: "I think my form and execution are a bit slow. We lost the game today, and we lost it in an unacceptable way. We need to fix some problems. Now that the game is just beginning, we have time to change it. It's all about me. I need to reflect and learn from today's game and move forward.
In fact, it's not just fultz. Today, the magic team is in a slump. In the first half, the shooting percentage of the whole team was only 28.9%, and the first five players scored only 12 points in 4 out of 22 shots.
When Aron Gordon talked about the team's defeat after the game, he warned everyone.

Gordon took everyone, including him, for granted. They are not strong enough to despise their opponents. Gordon believes that today's game is a good pre-season game, and they have time to adjust when the alarm is sounded.
Coach Steve Cliffy is full of anger. When talking about the team's performance, Cliffy believes that there are too many problems to be solved, such as the fluency of the offensive side, how the defensive side suppresses the ball holder, which the team needs to solve completely in the pre-season.

The Magic got Fultz and wanted to scrape off the scrape. At least they put their hopes on Fultz to raise the team's cap. From a realistic point of view, Fultz's strange illness has made him a long way from the top-notch Bauer and the flower detector Tatum.
Maybe the first point guard who was unstoppable in the College League really couldn't come back.

We all know that magic has not been a good way to train players in the past. Basically, few players have become superstars in recent years. Even Auladipo had been sent away, and now they were the backbone of the pedestrians.
