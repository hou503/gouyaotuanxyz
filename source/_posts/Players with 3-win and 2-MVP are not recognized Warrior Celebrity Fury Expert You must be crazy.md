"Watching a program recently really drives me crazy. Damon Jones and Hollins... For these two people, my God, I think there should be a rule not to let players who can't get 10 or 20 points per game in their career or any season comment on the game on TV, and people who can't get 10 or 20 points per game comment on the game. I don't know what the program wants to express.
It's a famous warrior. Stephen Jackson, once a famous "sage of war", denounced the remarks of television specialists in his social media.

​
So what topic did these so-called experts discuss? Damon Jones and Hollins, both former NBA players, recently joined ESPN's more famous talk show First Take and then discussed who needs to prove themselves in the new season, Stephen Cooley and James Harden.
In the show, Damon Jones thought that Curie needed to prove himself more than James Harden, which annoyed Stephen Jackson, a warrior. He shouted angrily, "Come on, Curie has three champions and has won two MVPs. What else does he need to prove? Harden hasn't won the championship yet. Why does Curie need to prove himself more than Harden?

​
Stephen Jackson's remarks are offensive. He also mentioned the average score of players. In fact, in ESPN programs, there are always former NBA players and even big stars to participate in the discussion. Some Hall of Fame players such as Pippen and McGrady are also frequent guests.
However, Hollins and Damon Jones have to go a little further according to Jackson's criteria. Hollis has only scored 3.7 points per game in his career, and no season has scored more than 10 points per game.
Damon Jones, by contrast, scored an average of 6.6 points in his career and 11.6 points in the 2004-2005 season for the Heat.
Of course, it does not mean that if the NBA does not play well, it must not understand the ball, which is also linked to physical fitness, playing characteristics.
But in the NBA to play an average of more than 20 points, it has touched the threshold of stars, this level of stars, must be online players and physical fitness, some players even the combination of the top, so we can go to the super-giant road.

​
Then the problem returned to Curie and Harden, who scored 23.5 points in his career and averaged 30.1 points, 5.4 rebounds and 6.7 assists in the 15-16 season of his peak season, with 180 clubs'shooting percentage per game. In addition, he led the league with 2.1 steals per game and was elected the first full-vote MVP in history.
Last season, Harden had scored the only season since the amalgamation of NBA and ABA. Michael Jordan scored 36.1 points per game. He was the top scorer in the last four seasons. His terrible scoring ability has been selected by the players'Union as the most defensive player in the League for several seasons.

​
So both players have already won MVP, and then we have to discuss in the program whether we need to continue to prove ourselves?
More horrible, as a master of the age of small ball, Curie has led the Warriors to the finals five times in a row in the fierce competition in the West, and won three championships in five years. However, such a Curie in people's eyes is not a proof of himself? It's really some exaggeration.

​
Of course, what the program needs is the topic, even if the guests did not want to release along the way, but the answer to the question of who needs to prove themselves more in Curie and Harden is foolish no matter who chooses. MVP players don't need to prove themselves to anyone. They've proven it with their results.
