​
What are the conditions for 1000 points in the Finals? The most important premise is to enter the Finals first. Even NBA stars and even superstars can satisfy only a few.
Being able to reach the finals under the heavy blockade of each division is already a person who can stand at the top of the league. Such people are also top of the pyramid. But to achieve 1000 points in the final, we need not only to stand at the top of the pyramid, but also to maintain there. This requires not only super strength support, some of them. It takes a little bit of luck.
Even with a score of 25 points per game, a total of 40 finals will be required. A total of 40 finals will require at least six series matches to reach, and 40 playoffs will be a huge threshold in the NBA, let alone 40 finals.
This represents the difficulty of 1000 points in the Finals. In fact, the superstars who can really finish 1000 points in the Finals are basically in the forefront of history.

​
Let's take Curie as an example. Curie and his Warriors have risen since the 2014-15 season. They have entered the finals five times in a row. They are still in the more competitive Western Division. This is the first time in the history of the NBA. It is more sufficient to illustrate the strength and domination of the Warriors.
Curie also played 28 finals in these five tournaments, averaging 26.46 points per game, ranking tenth in history, but in the five consecutive years of the finals, Curie only accumulated 741 points, ranking 14th in history, side by side with George McCann.
In fact, Curie's total score in the Finals is not low. His total score has surpassed Duncan, Wade, Larry Bird and many famous hosts or gods, but there is still a long way to go before the 1000 points in the Finals.

​
The strength of this year's warriors has been weakened and the future is uncertain, but the difficulty of Kuri's return to the Finals must be increased. Whether his Finals score can continue to increase by 1000 points is not clear now.
Even better than Kobe Bryant, who has won five championships and made seven career finals, the total score in the finals is not more than 1,000 points, which is enough to show how difficult this achievement is.

​
Kobe Bryant made seven finals in his career and won five championships. His total score reached 937 points. He was able to rank 11th in history, but he still lagged behind 1000 points and failed to break through.
In fact, throughout the history of the NBA, there were only nine gods who scored 1,000 points in the Finals, among which the Celtics in the Russell period accounted for a lot of places, while only LeBron James scored 1,000 points in the active NBA Finals.

​
James made eight consecutive finals in our opinion, but in fact it is a rare miracle. James, who has made nine finals trips in his career, has scored more than 1,000 points in the finals and reached 1383 points, ranking second in history. Only Jerry West (1679), who was the first in history, has scored more than 1,000 points in the finals. Less than 300 points.
This summer, the Lakers changed their lineup, the combination of James and Fueyebrow, and the team's excellent players made it more realistic for James to return to the Finals. Even though James is over 34 and a half years old this year, James's name has this magical power.

​
But the difficulty of hitting the first place in history is still not small. This is not a finals can be completed. Even if Rick Barry scored 36.3 points in the 296 points in the finals, it would take at least eight games, that is to say, at least two finals trips, if James were to do it himself. Average 28.2 points per game, the seventh speed in history, also need more than 10 games.

What's more, from the horrible West to the finals, we also need to face the fast boats of small cards and pickled peppers, the Rockets of Weishao and Harden, and the rest of the strong teams are watching eagerly. It's not easy to talk about a hundred-foot pole. James's score of 1383 in the second finals of history is legendary. Let's think about it again. There are possibilities in the history of the Finals, but it is particularly difficult at the age of 34.
