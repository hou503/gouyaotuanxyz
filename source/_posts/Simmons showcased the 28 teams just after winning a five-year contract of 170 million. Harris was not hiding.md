Last season, 76 players undoubtedly became the most unfortunate team in the league. They were just short of beating the Raptors. Leonard's seventh winner shattered 76 people's dreams. Otherwise, 76 people might have rushed out of the East to win the championship.
Because last season's 76-man lineup was totally unafraid of the impact of the Bucks alphabet, and there was Butler at that time. But 76 people were horrible, even though they lost Butler this summer.
But 76 people got Richard Sen from the Heat, which could at least fill Butler's flanking line after he left.

Another 76 have signed Hofford and renewed Simmons and Harris. In that case, the 76-man lineup is extremely strong, five-star for Harris + Simmons + Embed + Hofford + Richardson.
In the previous pre-season win over the Hornets, 76 people showed everyone their horrible offensive proficiency in the absence of Ambid. After Walker left the Hornets, Rozil was the substitute. But Rozil's strength is far from Walker's.
Master Jordan's signing is likely to be in trouble again. Rozil can't carry the wasp's banner.

Another 76 players are currently the tallest team in the Eastern Conference, and the combination of Enbede and Hofford has basically restrained the Bucks in the style of play. It's the Bucks that can compete with 76 players in the Eastern region. Now the style of play is restrained by 76 players. It seems that 76 players have great hope of breaking out of the Eastern region next season.
Simmons, the top player in the summer, has also been practicing his three-point long-range shooting ability, although it has not been a great threat. But Simonsken's hard work in shooting is a good way to raise the 76-man team cap.
What are the goals of the 76 players for next season? Simmons also revealed his plans today to upgrade defense to the top of the league and win the championship.

Simmons said: "The most important thing for our team is the championship, and the most important thing for us in the new season is defense. We want to be the best defensive team in the NBA league.
We don't know if 76 people can win the championship. Maybe there's a chance. But I want to take defense to the top of the league. It seems harder than winning the championship. Simmons really doesn't take the other 28 teams into consideration. I'm afraid Enbede dares not say that he can improve his defense to the first place in the league.
As for why the 28 teams? Because one team has been removed, but the others are innocent.

Last season, 76 players ranked 15th in defensive efficiency and 19th in loss per game. If 76 players want to improve their defense to the first place in the league, it will not only require Simmons to invest more in defense, but also Harris from the front line to strengthen defense.
Harris, as we all know, was not known for his defense in the past. He was called Zhongpai Anthony. On the offensive side, Harris is similar to Melon, but on the defensive side, he moves slowly.
Harris may be a little faster than Melon, but he's never both offensive and defensive. He's got three points, but he's very defensive.

Only when Harris was interviewed today, he did not agree with the general view of the outside world on his defense. Harris was not hiding. He told reporters that he had practiced defense hard this summer and he wanted to be one of the best defenders.
Harris said, "I know the criticism from the outside world. I moved slowly and had a bad defense at the bottom. These are the issues I've been thinking about this summer. What I can tell you now is that I did spend a lot of time defending this summer. Because I want to be a very good player at both ends of the offense and defense, let defense be the focus of my game, I want to win the championship, but also want to be one of the best defenders in the league!

Previously, Buckley had predicted that 76 men would be the only team in the finals next season. They had no team in the East to threaten them.
