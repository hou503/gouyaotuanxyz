There are not many players in the NBA who have not played in the playoffs, but they are not without them. In fact, one of the previous examples is very prominent, that is, Corsins before injury. Cosins joined the league in 2010, first playing for the Kings, but failed to lead the team into the playoffs for eight years.
Although Cosins has strong personal ability, he still can't play in the playoffs. Only 8 of the 15 teams can enter the playoffs. Under the jungle, this is also a very competitive thing, let alone in the more competitive West.

​
Originally in the 2017-18 season, Cosins was able to enter the playoffs without any accident, but he suffered a serious Achilles tendon injury. After that, he was not so happy in the Warriors'playoff trip.
Cosins is only an example of course, in fact, the stars do not say to enter the finals, the difficulty of entering the playoffs is not so great, but to enter the playoffs for a long time, that is the absolute ability to reflect. And the first test of star standards, often is the results, can lead the team to win the star, is the real superstar, and victory usually means the ticket to the playoffs.
So, in the history of the NBA, the total ranking of playoff scoring should also be a reference to the success of the stars.

We all know that Jordan is probably the most dazzling star in the history of the NBA, but in fact the first place in the history of the NBA playoffs is not Jordan. Jordan has been surpassed by one person several years ago, only ranking second in history, and the surpassing person is LeBron James.
At the same time, James is the only player in active service who can reach the top 10 in total playoff scores.

​
So far, James's playoff total score has already reached 6911 points, ranking first in NBA history, exceeding Jordan's second place by nearly 1000 points. According to the development of the Lakers today, James's playoff score may continue to rise. After James retires, this playoff total score will also become him. The hardest to break in the record book.

​
Jordan, the second-place player, scored 5,987 points, but in fact, Jordan's 15-year career, excluding the rookie season and the last two farewell seasons, all entered the playoffs, and then averaged 33.4 points in the first playoff season, ranking second in the playoff history.

​
The third place is Jabbar's 5762 points. Jabbar has also been a great figure in his career for 20 years. His total score in the regular season is still the highest in history, and his third place in the playoffs is not uncommon.
The fourth place is Kobe Bryant, with a total score of 5640. Kobe's 220 playoff appearances are also the sixth place in history, with an average score of 10. But considering Kobe's role as a substitute in his early career and his injuries in his later career, maybe he can do better!

The fifth place was O'Neill, who scored 5,250 points. It's interesting that Bryant still has to put pressure on his old opponent and old friend in this matter.
Duncan, the sixth place, 5,172 points. Duncan's existence is the absolute dependence of the Spurs dynasty. The Ivy League has stacked Duncan in this position for more than 20 years.
The seventh place was Karl Malone, who scored 4761 points in the playoffs, the eighth was Logo, who scored 4457 points, and the ninth was Tony Parker, who scored 4045 points in the GDP portfolio of the Spurs.

Durant is another superstar in the top ten in active service. In fact, Death is only two points away from Parker. Waiting for Durant to return from injury, it is not difficult for him to move up his ranking.
