​
The Raptors and 76 men took seven battles. The Raptors rotated seven and 76 eight. The defense of both sides tore a whole game.
The 25-year-old had the highest 45-minute playing time, while the 34-year-old Mark Gasol went out to follow him for the team's highest 45 minutes, more than the absolute core of the Raptors, Leonard.
Leonard made the highest 39 shots in his career. In this game, Nass finally stopped fighting. Instead, he concentrated all the stage and all the shots on Kawaii, which proved to be the only way for the Raptors to win.
Eventually, such a resounding battle ended with Leonard's horrifying and frightening bullet-frame whistle-pressing killing.
The four bounces of the ball bouncing over the basket, the 1-2 seconds, seemed to hold the breath of all the people around the world who were watching the game, including all the players on and off the court.

​
The dishonest, but ultimately seemed to resist the goal that 23,300 spectators in the Canadian Aviation Center Stadium would fall into the net, ending two cycles, one about Leonard in 2013 and the other about the Raptors in 2001.

Leonard 2013
Leonard, who played for San Antonio Spurs in the G6 finals in 2013, stood on the free throw line 19.4 seconds before the final.
At that time, the Spurs were 3-2 ahead of the three giant Heat teams, while the G6 Spurs were two points ahead of the Heat, which sent Leonard to the free throw line with foul tactics.
As long as Leonard withstands the pressure, the Spurs, who are four points ahead of the two penalties, will almost lock in the win.
And that's the penalty shot that might determine the championship. Leonard, who was 22 at the time, had only one in two.
The next thing is that the NBA Finals are enough to go down in history.
After the suspension, the Heat handed the ball to James, who missed three points from the top of the left arc. But the high-flying basketball fell into Chris Bosh's right hand.

​
Bosh turned around and handed the ball to Ray Allen at the bottom corner like fate. Ray Allen jumped up against Parker and hit the most critical three-point in history for the Heat.
The game eventually went into overtime. One of Leonard's two penalties and three points from Ray Allen may have exhausted the Spurs'spirit. The Heat finally united to win the G6. In the end, the Heat finished the reverse and won two consecutive championships.
Today, the same thing seems to happen to Leonard again.

​
In the last 10.8 seconds, 76 people sent Leonard to the free throw line for a tactical foul. In the Eastern Semi-Final Seventh World War, a life-and-death stage, such as robotic Leonard also appeared "machine failure".
Leonard eventually hit one of the two penalties, which directly led to 76 people grabbing the counter-attack, Butler scored the equalizing layup, leaving the Raptors with the last 4.2 seconds.
In 4.2 seconds, with the ball near the midline, Leonard dribbled patiently to the bottom right corner, where he had many wins in the season, which is his favorite area.
Faced with Simmons and Embed's sandwich, speed up the breakthrough, and then at the bottom corner, stop and fall back, the ball from the hands of the small card high jump, press the final whistle, play to the basket four knocks, the final hits! _____________

​
This is the first time in the history of the NBA playoffs to win four games in seven games. Leonard spent all his time. This time, the goddess of luck stood beside Leonard.
It seems to be the same story six years ago. This time, Leonard, who left the Spurs for the Arctic, wrote a different ending.

Raptors 2001
In fact, the 2001 Eastern Semi-Final was between 76 men and Raptors, and more coincidentally, both semi-finals reached the seventh, or even the last round of the Seventh World war.
It was the league's first record and 76 people with MVP Allen Iverson who last laughed to the end. This time, the Goddess of Victory favored the Raptors more.
In 2001, the last minute of the Seventh World War, with two seconds left, the 76-man team, 88-87 in the lead, was in the hands of one of the opposing teams.
Dunking king Vince Carter rounded the top of the arc to the bottom left corner, hit the ground pass, turned back and jumped high. At that moment, 76 people in the First League Center Hall almost suffocated.
"Bang!" The high arc shot was originally intended to ensure that the hollow ball was brushed into the basket, but did not want to resist the fate of the choice, the 183 fighter with the ball out of the box running around, was worshipped by Philadelphia fans.
The AI released behind the technology stage is like a saint, and in the shadow behind it, Vince Carter is sad.

​
Eighteen years ago, even though the Raptors regretted not reaching the Eastern Finals, the young team was still full of hope.
No one expected that after 18 years, the Raptors, whose best result was to stop in the Eastern Finals, could not go any further, so they traded away the core of their training and recruited Cawaii-Leonard.
It was Kawaii's winner that brought the Raptors back to the Eastern Finals again. The regret of 18 years ago ended their reincarnation here, and this time, Leonard's Raptors might have done something even greater.

Toronto's Present and Future
Toronto naturally loves the powerful Leonard. Every time Leonard stands on the free throw line, the deafening MVP calls represent their desire for the superstar.
This is also the goal of the Raptors this summer. Leonard's arrival at the Raptors is actually a helpless move to play a farce with the Spurs.
The Raptors hope that through this year's coexistence and influence, at the same time, they will try to make some impact on Leonard's future direction.
This is closely related to their performance in this year's playoffs. How can the Raptors finish this year's playoffs, Eastern Finals? Eastern champion? Even champions?
Toronto should not only be ecstatic about the victory, but in fact this promotion, this killing, to some extent, has helped the Raptors to add some weight to retain Leonard.
This will give them the chance to compete with the Clippers in the summer.

Leonard's rare seven-whistle strike ended his personal and team rotation, and now the burden is all thrown aside. A new story is unfolding.
