​
Zhou Qi's recent news is quite a lot, and most of the content is negative. The most remarkable thing is that Wang Shipeng, the eldest brother of Chinese basketball, openly criticized Zhou Qi on Weibo.
Wang Shipeng, as a meritorious task of Chinese basketball, is also a representative of the golden generation of 08. Of course, he has a very high position in the domestic basketball circle. Although he did not mention Zhou Qi in his micro-blog, his words imply Zhou Qi's identity.
Later, according to reporters, the chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association and the Chinese basketball coaching team also intervened in the incident and mediated the emotions of both sides. In Wang Shipeng's subsequent update of the micro-blog, Zhou Qi has been directly @ and the time of this contradiction has also been concluded.
But the incident itself is somewhat strange. Zhou Qi, the central figure of the incident, did leave a bad impression on people.

# The reason is late and unprovoked breaking an appointment.
"Eventually know why you can't play the NBA", "Rockets are afraid to cultivate a superstar bigger than Paul and Harden", "basketball circle has been mixed for so many years, the first time to see such a big brand". These words have expressed Wang Shipeng's outrage.
Most importantly, Wang Shipeng also mentioned the following sentence: "I can't believe what I heard before", which is very interesting.
What would have happened to those things that I had heard before? Some fans must still remember the 2016 Rio Olympics, when Zhou Qi also represented China in the Olympic Games.
In the whole group tournament of the Olympic Games, the whole Chinese team has not won because of its inferior skills, and the gap of strength has indeed emerged in this high-level competition.
This result is not surprising to the domestic fans, but Zhou Qi's pride was also reflected in the match against Serbia.
In a Serbian attack, two of the other side's inside lines were covered up, and Zhou Qi and Yi Jianlian had some problems in the exchange of defense, which ended with Zhou Qi's failure to converge after rushing out.
After this round, Zhou Qi and Yi Jianlian have some communication, but the picture can clearly see that Zhou Qi's mouth said, "This can also blame me me".
In fact, we don't need to discuss who's wrong in this round, but Yi Jianlian is the absolute core of the national team. Rio Olympic Games scored an average of 20.4 points per game to set the career Olympic Games average score record. Zhou Qi at that time, fearing confrontation, drifted outside shooting, averaging 5.2 points and 1.2 rebounds per game, was obviously too much. Too young.

# Zhou Qi has talent, but what he needs to really work hard is attitude.
If you have the ability of arrogance, maybe sometimes the strength of the supreme professional sports can tolerate, but Zhou Qi's growth in the NBA, also did not meet the expected standards.

​
In the two years of NBA career, Zhou Qi played only 19 games, with a maximum score of only 6 points, averaging only a pitiful 1.3 points and 1.2 rebounds. The Rockets have been careful and patient with Zhou Qi, but Zhou Qi still failed to meet the expectations of the Rockets.
Therefore, it is inevitable to leave the NBA, but Zhou Qi's off-court attitude during the NBA is still relatively general. No matter any player in the NBA, even sitting on the bench, he has to help the team prepare. And his phrase "I didn't expect the coach to send me on the pitch, I wasn't ready" is obviously not professional enough to cope with and prepare.

Recently, according to domestic basketball reporters, Zhou Qi has split up with U.S. agent O'Connor, and he is trying to find a new U.S. agent.
It's not clear whether Zhou Qi will return to the United States, but he can only take the World Cup as a last chance to show off. He must perform strongly in order to win at least the chance for himself.
In terms of ability, not only his talent and growth, but also his preparation and attitude towards professional competition, which is what Zhou Qi really needs to improve.
