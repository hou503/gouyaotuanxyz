At the end of last year, many fans may be surprised when they were laid off, but it seems understandable from Zhou Qi's repeated demotion to the Rockets and his own performance on the pitch.
In his two-year NBA career, Zhou Qi spent most of his time with the Ogrand Valley Serpent Team, which belongs to the Rockets. After all, as a second-round show, the team's expectations for him were not so great, and the Chinese market behind Zhou Qi has always been the focus of the Rockets.

Zhou Qi played 12 minutes in the game. He made 2 of 6 shots and 2 of 3 of 4 shots. He finally got 6 points, 2 baskets, 1 assists and 1 blocked shot. The 3 points in 4-2 are enough to surprise people, and Zhou Qi's frontal cap against Wilson Chandler on the defensive side fanned the ball out of the line directly, which made the fans on the spot exclaim.

Zhou Qi's two-year NBA career is also over. Whether Zhou Qi will continue to attack the NBA in the future, and this year only 23-year-old Zhou Qi naturally still has a lot of hope. We naturally hope that Zhou Qi will one day stand on the stage of the NBA with a stronger posture and blossom a better self.
