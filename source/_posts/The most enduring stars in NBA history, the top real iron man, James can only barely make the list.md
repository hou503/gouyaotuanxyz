DeMarcus-Cousins again injured his left leg, this time, but not the previous Achilles tendon rupture, not this year's playoff quadriceps tear, but the knee, another fatal position for professional athletes.
Earlier this morning, according to Shams, Corzins suffered a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament. Woj followed up that Corzins suffered a knee injury caused by a collision with a man during training in Las Vegas on Monday, local time.

It's the third major injury Cosins has suffered in nearly two years. Compared with Achilles tendon rupture and cruciate ligament tear, the quadriceps thigh tear in the playoffs this year is not even worth mentioning.
Yes, Achilles tendon and cruciate ligament injuries are the top two most serious injuries that affect the career of professional athletes in the United States. These two injuries, which Cosins has experienced for two years, are regrettable and heartbreaking.
Competitive sports are cruel. Cousins'successive injuries may make him fade out of the League soon. Perhaps the biggest enemy of professional players on the field is not the opponent standing opposite the court, but the relentless injury.
Injuries, in the NBA destroyed too many geniuses, Cosins injured before, as if there have been many calls for the league's first center, but after the injury, until now, he can only use the base salary to fight for their own opportunities. Such examples are not uncommon in the long history of the NBA.
Similarly, relatively speaking, to be able to enter the NBA from the beginning to reach the top of the League steadily, not only requires the support of talent, a body that can withstand the wind and rain is also essential.

Let's take a look at the statistics today. There are few superstars in the history of the NBA who have been plagued by injuries.
Although James suffered a rare injury in his career last season, and missed more than 10 games because of injury, which set a career record, throughout his career, James's physical endurance is quite high.
Too many times I have seen James stamp his foot and grind his teeth after spraining his ankle, and he has missed 98 games in 16 seasons of his career so far because of injury, which is the premise of counting 27 games last season. On the premise of such a healthy enough condition, James's historical talent has also been well developed, and his present historical position has been accumulated in the 16 years of struggle.

​
Jabbar's career also lasted for 20 years. In those days when the players'training facilities and physical protection were not systematic, Jabbar's career length and height were impressive enough.
Jabbar's 20-year career has also made him the NBA's leading scorer so far, and his 20-year career has only missed 80 games, with an average of only four absences per season. This attendance rate is also terrible.

​
Above Jabbar is a pair of partners, Jazz's famous two-time veterans, Karl-Malone and Stockton's combination, Karl-Malone's career in the first 18 seasons, the absence of each season is no more than three, but also 10 seasons to play 82 games, "Postman" is the title, "rain or shine." Postman always serves in time.
Stockton was even more horrible, with 17 full-time seasons in 19 seasons of his career, of which 16 played 82 games, which also created his history of assisting king honor, accumulated over the years, the result is that.

And the famous iron man in history is not Elvin Hayes. Hayes was elected to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1990. He also had 21 points and 12.5 rebounds in his career. The most amazing thing about him was that in his 16-year career, he had missed only nine games, and the attendance rate was just horrible.
