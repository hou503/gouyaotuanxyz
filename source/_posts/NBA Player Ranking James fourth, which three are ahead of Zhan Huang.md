The 42-year-old Carter has been awarded a new contract extension from the Hawks, which means that the former "demigod" will start his 22nd NBA season. For 22 consecutive seasons, it is also extremely rare in the history of the NBA.
Not surprisingly, Old Carter's regular-season appearances will surpass Stockton and Nowitzki next season and rise to third place in the history of the NBA. With Nowitzki's retirement last season, Carter became the most active NBA player with 1481 appearances.

​
So what are the top ten players in active service besides Carter?
No. 2 was Jamal Crawford from the Suns, who played 1326 games. Crawford played 64 games last season, averaging 7.9 points and 3.6 assists in 18.9 minutes. So far Crawford has not been awarded an NBA contract, although he has played 19 seasons in the league, but apparently he can make a lot of contributions on the court.
The third is Paul Gasol, who has just signed a one-year contract with the Trail Blazers, who has played 1226 games so far. Gasol played 30 games last season, averaging only 3.9 points and 4.6 rebounds per game. Gasol, who still had enough heat in the Spurs in the first half of the season, was traded to the Bucks and did not have much chance to play because of his incompatibility with the team's style. But as a veteran, his leadership is not to be underestimated, Gasol will be a powerful complement to the pioneers.

​
Next came LeBron James of the Lakers, who played 1198 games. Years seem to have left no trace on the historical superstar. James averaged 27 points, 8 rebounds and 8 assists per game last season, with a shooting percentage of more than 50%.
Even though he has played 16 seasons in the league, James has maintained the league's first-class level with super self-control and hard training, which is unusual in the history of the NBA.
In the new season, the Lakers signed Anthony Davis stars and many excellent role players, James will also make another impact on the championship in his 17th season.

​
The fifth place was Kyle Cowell from the Bucks, who played 1174 games. As one of the only two remaining players in the league in 2003 (James, the other), when he became a free agent, Covol quickly handed out the rugby branch to the Bucks. He finally chose a contract of 2.6 million a year to join the Bucks. Kowal's career three-point shooting rate is as high as 42.9%. He is a phenomenal three-point shooter. His joining will greatly increase the Bucks'hope of breaking out of the East.
The sixth is Tyson Chandler, who has just joined the Rockets and has played 1134 games. The champion will also help the new double-core Rockets become a hot team for championship.

​
Seventh in the list is Andre Igdala, who was traded to Grizzlies by the Warriors, with 1108 appearances. The former FMVP couldn't change the game because of his injuries, but when the team needed it, Igdala would open the coffin and become an important part of the competition.
The next three longest-serving NBA players were Patria (1098 games), Cameron Anthony (1064 games) and Dwight Howard (1044 games).
Dead people like this, day and night. I hope you fans will cherish every game of the players and every inch of the time we watch the ball. It is not only the professional career of the players, but also our youth that will grow old.
