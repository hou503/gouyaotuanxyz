# The situation of the Warriors is somewhat similar to that before the G6 against the Rockets.
The Warriors without Durant had actually won six consecutive wins in the final 0-1 down, but the loss made everyone seem to be leaning toward the Raptors.
The score is backward, the outside world is generally optimistic about the opponent, not a life-and-death battle, but lost will also fall into a great passive, this situation, it seems that the Warriors have just experienced this year's playoffs.
On that occasion, the warriors responded with the lack of Durant's remnants, and the three armies eventually defeated the powerful rockets to reach the Western Final.
It must be admitted that the Rockets are indeed the most powerful opponent the Warriors have ever faced in the past few years.
The Rockets pushed the Golden State Warriors to their seventh game in the 2017-18 season, and even the Rockets, which had a home advantage in the seventh game, led the Warriors in the first half.
This year, in the playoffs of 2018-19, the Rockets and Warriors met ahead of schedule in the second round, and each side won two home games in the first four games, with a big score of 2-2.
In the battle of Tianwangshan, the Warriors led by 20 points at one time and the momentum of the home court was overwhelming, but the Rockets were able to drag the pace extremely calmly and catch up with the score slowly.

The situation was in fact in the hands of the Warriors until Kevin Durant fell with an injury.
Durant pulled his right calf after an unopposed mid-shot in the third quarter and suddenly limped. In that scene, the hearts of more than 20,000 spectators in Oracle Stadium were seized instantly.
The Warriors understand the importance of Kevin Durant to the team. His strong personal ability is the best breaker when the Warriors are in danger. And when the Rockets slow down the pace of the game and are about to pull the situation back, Durant hit the center of the stable army.
But after the mid-shot, Durant had no choice but to leave, and the Warriors soon learned that Durant could not return to the game.
The Warriors should be most grateful for Kuri's recovery from G5 Durant's departure. Curie's 16 points in Durant's 14 minutes were too crucial because it would be too difficult for the Warriors to keep suspense in the series if they lost the battle in Tianwangshan.
But even if the Warriors won the battle of Tianwangshan, without a superstar Durant who averaged 35 points per game, the Warriors became the underrated team.
Even though the Warriors are 3-2 ahead, on the one hand, the Warriors are going to Houston's home court, and this series of warriors have not yet conquered Houston's home court;
On the other hand, the Warriors can only adjust their rotation passively after lacking Durant. Before G6, the Warriors'bench can give little support to the team.
Everything is going in a bad direction, but the Warriors are fighting for a chance in that desperate quagmire.

# The last warrior stood the test
The Warriors withstood the test of desperation and finally beat the Houston Rockets to head up for the Western Conference finals.
"When KD is present, you still have some room for laziness. We just need to give him the ball and he can score. So he couldn't play and we had to make adjustments, which was certainly a bit like going back to the past for us. Dream chase talked about the impact of the absence of KD on the team in an interview after the game.
It's true that with Durant as a super-strong finish point to pass the ball and cooperate with the Warriors, Durant is accustomed to throwing difficult problems to Durant, and Durant's personal abilities are fully within his grasp.
Over time, other Warriors will be inert and dependent on KD when they encounter difficulties, but with the overall strength of the Warriors, they can still use many ways to overcome difficulties.
But Durant's absence has put all the warriors into a state of high tension, which may double the pressure on the players and imbalance the mentality, but the warriors who have experienced too many big scenes face the challenge directly.
In the G6 game, the Warriors really accomplished the life of the three armies, and Clay in the opening and the first half was like a killer possession. The Rockets certainly know that without Durant, Curie and Clay must be the focus of attention, but many of Clay's first half goals were unreasonable goals that could not be created.

​
Even though Curie suffered foul trouble in the first half, there were Jerebko's rebounds, Livingston's old man chatting about juvenile madness, Cook's quick drop and three points, McKinney's rebounds, dream chase series, one brother's three points, Luni's struggle, the Warriors insisted.
In the second half, Kuri recovered in time and failed to disappoint everyone. In the second half, Kuri scored a career-high 33 points, which ranked second in NBA history.
Even though finger injuries still afflict Curie's nerves, at the most critical moment of the team, that sense of responsibility and mission has also been painful, overwhelming internal doubts, Curie's outbreak has made the Warriors team into the strongest state.
In the fourth quarter, the Warriors made almost perfect decisions, each cooperation had a clear arrangement, and every goal was undisputed.
Kuri scored 23 points in the fourth quarter, including three points in cooperation with Dream Pursuit, three points in the face of Tucker's tight defense, breakthroughs and throws in judging the situation, and eight penalties in the last minute, which completely stifled the Rockets'intention to fight back.
It must be said that even though the Warriors have played close to or even more than 100 games every year in the past few years, it is rare for the Warriors to show their overall Championship will in the semi-final against the Rockets after the outbreak of G6, which has been looked down upon by the whole world.

# Warriors have proved countless times that they are trustworthy.
This time, on the stage of the Finals, the Warriors seem to have once again become the underrated side after losing the first game of the Finals.
The semi-final G6, even if the Warriors lose, is not the end of the world. They still have the possibility to return home to win the series, but the Warriors themselves are very clear that the more backward the game is, the better for the Rockets, so their G6 thunderbolts won with their lives.
The G2 of the Finals is somewhat similar in nature. Even if the Warriors lose the next G2, they can still go back to home and defend the home court to equalize the series.
But the Warriors certainly don't want to fall into this passive situation when their home advantage is lost, so the next G2 Warriors will still try their best to win.

​
Curie also expressed his views on the team's backwardness in the Finals after the game, saying: "Obviously we are very poor in 0-1, but this is not the end of the world. Along the way, we have new experience. We have proved our resilience and the ability to win the game. This game is a wake-up call for us. We will learn from such a night.
"The atmosphere in our dressing room was great and the opponents obviously played well, but our confidence remained unchanged. We'll shield all the noise and try to get out and grab the G2, and then we'll start.
"Anyway, we're looking at the whole series. It's been a long time. G2 is an opportunity for us to correct our mistakes. We'll win it and go back to Auckland."
The significance of this victory for the Warriors is also not small. The latest information about Durant's injury is that Durant will probably return to G4 in the Finals, and the possibility of G3's return is slight.
So if the Warriors G2 can win, they will create a better environment for Durant's comeback, and once Durant fully recovers and plays, the Warriors'advantage will become infinite.

Whether it's G6 in the Western Semi-Finals just past, G6 and G7 in the Western Finals last year, G3's reversal in the 2016-17 Finals, or the lessons learned in the 2016 Finals, or the 1-2 backward Jedi counterattack in the 2014-15 Finals.
The Warriors have gone through too much in the past five years on the way to the finals. They have accumulated the most abundant experience. They have also experienced the pain of losing the championship in a 3-1 lead and a tremendous reversal. They have grown up to be a mature king's teacher.
