So far in the season, the Lakers have exposed a very important problem. No one has been able to solve it in the past four games. I saw a little hope in the fifth game, that is, the Lakers' second lineup lacks an organizational attack point, a holding attack point or a second scoring point other than a thick eyebrow.

The problem will gradually improve from game 5.
In the game between the Lakers and the lone ranger, Kuzma, who was called the "third core" of the team by coach Vogel, made his first comeback. He played for 18 minutes, 3 of 8 shots, 4 of 3 points, 0 of 4 shots, got 9 points, 3 rebounds and 1 assists, with a positive and negative value of - 6. His performance was average, even a little bad. But because the Lakers won the game, no one went to investigate Kuzma's performance It has to be good or bad.
Since the world cup injury, Kuzma has not played for a long time, the data is not good, the performance of the game is not good enough, so it can not be concluded. He needs a period of time to adapt to the intensity of the game and his teammates. After Kuzma returns, he will play with bushmei to lead the second team. When James leads the team, there are more changes on the field. When the bushy eyebrows lead the team, what kind of position should Kuzma take to partner with him? It requires Kuzma to use at least five games to find feelings and appropriate positions.

In order to see in the game, how does Kuzma's return help the Lakers?
It may be a bit far fetched to say that he is a shooting point, because his ability of shooting outside the three-point line is "very stable", 30% last season. In this game, he can only be said to be able to shoot in four shots, but you have to say how good he is, there is no evidence at all, and his ability to create projection outside the three-point line is not as good as pop and cook.
Kuzma mainly plays without the ball. In the game, when the bushbrow is in the low back single, when other players are holding the ball, Kuzma's free cutting at this time is very effective, which can drive the defense and create the chance of layup. If a good chemical reaction is established between Kuzma and his teammates, this kind of free cutting will be a regular game for the Lakers in the second team Surgery. He does have a set of running and cutting, and the finishing ability is good. One of the three goals in the first show is that he received a pass from his team-mates at the low post.

Why Kuzma is so optimistic about Vogel? It's mainly because he is very talented on the offensive side. His holding ability is effective, but his non ball ability is much better than pop's. Kuzma's catching and jumping ability is excellent, catching and hitting the basket is excellent, and under the basket finishing ability is excellent, so if you want to choose one of BOPP and Kuzma to play tactics, Kuzma is much better than BOPP. With the help of Howard's cover, the Lakers can circle from the low post to the top of the arc, catch the ball and shoot and hit the basket. These are all tactics that the Lakers can't play before Kuzma returns. After Kuzma returns, the Lakers' tactical flexibility will be greatly enhanced. Maybe Rondo is still needed to organize the game, but compared with the first four games, the attack end of the second team of the Lakers will be greatly improved.

It can also be seen from the first show that Kuzma's return has a greater impact on the three people in the team.
The first one is Dudley. He didn't get the playing time in this game. Originally, the average playing time was only 8 minutes. Now after Kuzma came back, the Lakers have position 4. With projection, Dudley's defense is not very good, so he basically won't get the chance.
The second and third are Mackey and Howard. McGrady played only 11 minutes in this game. As a starting center, it seems only nominal now. Because McGrady's defense is not very good, so he is always replaced by Howard. In the regular rotation time of this game, the time that Howard should have played was when Vogel went to Kuzma. At the same time, he let bushmei play No. 5. Howard played every game The time was already more than 20 points. Because of the height of the lone ranger, Vogel made an exception and let Howard play the last 12 minutes and the extra time game of 5 minutes, which was only 26 minutes in total.

So if it's a regular rotation, Howard's time should be less than 20 minutes. The rest of the time is for the thick eyebrows to hit the center and Kuzma to play position 4. Now the Lakers have basically confirmed the rotation mode. No matter if there is rondo or not, bushmei must lead the second team. If there is no such main attack point, other teammates will go out without fear, and someone must hold down pop and cook. In this way, Kuzma and bushmei play at the same time, Howard's time will be compressed.
If Kuzma's defensive effectiveness improves, McGee and Howard will have less time to play.
