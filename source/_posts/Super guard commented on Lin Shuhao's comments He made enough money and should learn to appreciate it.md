Lin Shuhao, probably the strongest active basketball player in the world, failed to get an NBA contract extension in the free market despite winning the first NBA championship with the Raptors last season.
In his speech in Taiwan a few days ago, Lin Shuhao expressed his emotion that life is really difficult. The free market has become the last straw to crush him. The NBA seems not to want itself. For a time, his encounters and comments aroused widespread sympathy among players and fans. Even Wilkins, the famous Hawks player, said that it was difficult for Lin Shuhao to contact him at any time.
But there are also different voices. The Blazers super guard CJ-McCollem disagrees with him. McCollem believes that Lin Shuhao earned 65 million dollars in the league, which is a sufficient number. He should learn to be grateful more than those who have never been in the NBA.

Lin Shuhao lost the draft in 2010 and has been in the NBA League for nine years. In nine years, Lin Shuhao's total salary has reached 65.71 million US dollars, which is an unexpected figure for many people. When he first joined the league, Lin Shuhao tossed around and signed a two-year contract with the Warriors, a contract with partial guarantee for the 2010-11 season, team options for the second year and an annual salary of $470,000.
The following year, Lin Shuhao was laid off by the Warriors, followed by the Rockets, and the New York Knicks signed him with a partial guarantee contract of $760,000. Lin Shuhao seized the opportunity in New York and set off a storm of "forest madness" sweeping the world. But soon after, he was greeted with ligament tear, so that he was reimbursed for the season, which was the hottest period of his life.

​
After all, Lin Shuhao made his mark. During the off-season of 2012, the Rockets first offered Lin Shuhao a four-year contract worth $28.8 million, but the Knicks will match the contract.
In order to get Lin Shuhao, the Rockets changed the details of the contract and provided a new contract of $25 million for three years, 5 million for the first two years and 5.22 million for the third year, and up to $14.8 million for the third year. Many people in the industry call the contract "poison contract". Lin Shuhao also began his rocket career.
In the next three years, Lin Shuhao's performance did not match the contract. The Rockets chose to trade him to the Lakers in the third year. Lin Shuhao in the Lakers'time averaged 11.4 points and 4.6 assists in 25.8 minutes, which was also a passing answer.

​
In the off-season of 2015, Lin Shuhao chose a base salary of 2.1 million to join the Charlotte Hornets in order to prove himself again. In the Hornets, Lin Shuhao played well and helped him win what may be the last big contract in his career.
In the 2016 season, Lin Shuhao and the Brooklyn Nets reached a three-year contract of $36 million. In the first season of the Nets, he could get 14.5 points, 5.1 assists, 3.8 rebounds and 1.2 steals in 24 minutes, which was a good start for Lin Shuhao to start a new course, but injuries destroyed him again. Just after the start of the 2017 regular season, he suffered a ligament rupture that led to his reimbursement for the whole season. Then Lin Shuhao was traded to the Eagles.

​
Eagle is not fighting for the championship, just want to train the new star Trey Young, eager to win Lin Shuhao can only choose to buy out to join the Eastern Raptors. But in the last dozen games of the Raptors, Lin Shuhao did not seize the opportunity, and the playoffs became almost the last member of the bench. He did not get the chance to play in regular time, which led to the dilemma that the free market is still unknown for more than a month now.

As a yellow race, it is not easy to get to the present situation in the NBA. In the final analysis, the NBA is a business league, and it is impossible to impress the general managers of each team without good performance. But Lin Shuhao still has strength and can be the organizing point of the team's second line-up. Just give him a chance. I believe that Lin Shuhao will prove himself again.
