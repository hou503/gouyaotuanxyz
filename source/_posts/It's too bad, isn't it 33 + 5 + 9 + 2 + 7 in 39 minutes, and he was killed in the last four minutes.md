With about five minutes left in the game, the live video shows that the MVP of the game is Lillard, with 33 points and 8 out of 11 three points. In theory, the Blazers are 8 points ahead, with 5 minutes left in the game time. There is no sense of momentum on the 76ers' side, while on the Blazers' side, three shot Lillard, mccullham and hood can all provide enough energy. This MVP has no problems, but who knows it has been beaten!

When Lillard scored three-point goal in 5:05 seconds at the end of the game, he had already got 33 points, but he played another five minutes, until the end of the game, or 33 points, and he didn't get one point in the last five minutes. In any case, no matter how efficient Lillard's game was, as a star at home, he was more or less responsible.
In the whole game, Lillard played 39 minutes, 11 of 16 shots, 8 of 3-pointer 11, 3 of 3 free throws, got 33 points, 5 rebounds, 9 assists, 2 steals, and sent out 7 mistakes. Although the Blazers lost, his positive and negative value was + 7. If the Blazers win, Lillard is a worthy MVP, not only the data is good, but also the Blazers are under Lillard's leadership to pull the score to more than 20 points. When the 76ers in the fourth quarter chase the points, Lillard also uses the far-reaching key three points to stabilize the situation.

In the fourth quarter, Lillard played for 10 minutes, three-point, three shot, three shot, nine points, one rebounds and three assists. In the first five minutes, Lillard three-point shot three times, in the last five minutes, Lillard did not get a point? What happened?
In the previous period of time, the 76 man defense McCollam and Lillard adopted the strategy of releasing their shots. The Pioneer Center mentioned that after the three-point line was removed, the ball holder would be able to have a big space, because the 76 man center could not come up at all, and was still waiting for the rebound in the restricted area. But starting with Lillard's last three-point goal, the 76ers changed their defensive strategy, replacing o'aquin with hofford.
In the first round of holding the ball, it was the center's pick and break. At Horford, he grabbed the bag and caught Lillard. Lillard chose to give the ball to betsmore, who made a mistake in passing and was scored a three-point goal by Richardson.

In the second holding round, McCollam was ready to play pick and roll with Lillard. Houdford followed McCollam to the outside of the three-point line. The card position was very fierce, and even was blown foul. Although it was blown foul, it can be seen that the defense strategy and defense enthusiasm of 76 people have changed a lot.
In the third round, the Blazers arranged three people to cover Lillard outside the three-point line, but in exchange, the 76ers and three people, including Lillard, Richardson, hofford and Simmons, surrounded Lillard, and finally were robbed. Simmons scored 2 points in the fast break.
In the next round, Lillard stopped holding the ball and stood on his knees at a 45 degree corner to watch his teammates play. At this time, McCollam was ready to take over the game, but the defense was very close to the outside, so he was not allowed to catch the ball. In the end, mozbell forced his shot against hofford's defense and lost it.

In the fourth round of holding the ball, Lillard couldn't stand it. There was no way but for him to hold the ball and play the pioneer with more assurance. This time, it was changed to Harris defense. Lillard seemed a little tired, didn't change direction quickly, didn't accelerate suddenly, Harris didn't lose his position, Lillard didn't have a chance to shoot, and finally sent out a passing error. Back by hofford a violent deduction, the score will be traced to 1 point left.
In the fifth round of holding the ball, Lillard didn't need to pick and remove this time, but he couldn't pass Richardson. It can even be said that Lillard didn't want him. Maybe he was a little tired. He stopped the ball directly at the logo position. By reason of Lillard's explosive power and speed advantage, this position shouldn't be forced to stop. Then Lillard passed it to mccollham, and shot against the defense, three points on the iron. Then there was Simmons's 2-for-2, Simmons's 10 second quasi kill, and colkmaz's 2.2 second counter kill.

It can be seen from the last five minutes of these rounds that Lillard is a little tired. He played for 39 minutes. When the 76ers suddenly got on the defensive strength, Lillard obviously felt the pressure. The inner line didn't break in, the outer line didn't have a chance to shoot, and the 76ers didn't give Lillard a chance to play one by one in the wrong position. At last, they dare not play in the face of Richardson. When Lillard was in trouble, mccullham didn't come out. Hu De, who felt the hottest, left the field because of his injury. He had to give it to bezhmore. In this game, bezhmore played 25 minutes, got 7 points, 6 rebounds, 1 assists, 2 steals, 2 blocks, 2 mistakes, plus or minus - 18, the lowest in the whole game.
Lillard is really strong, this has to be admitted, but there is always a reason why he can't become a superstar, why he can't reach the finals.
