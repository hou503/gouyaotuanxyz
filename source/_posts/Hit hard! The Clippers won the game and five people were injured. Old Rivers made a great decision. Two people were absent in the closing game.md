Today, the Clippers defeated Melbourne United 118-100 in the NBA preseason. Two Clippers, Leonard and George, were absent from the game. Melbourne United were also very good. In the first half, they kept a firm grip on the Clippers because the two superstars were not there. Leading to the beginning is really not giving strength.
But Old Rivers still ambushed, not Harrell and Louis in the starting line-up, but continue to be on the bench. In this way, there are many times in today's competition when the Clippers lose points and the substitutes come up to chase points.

If it hadn't been for the Clippers'replacement Shuangxiong, the Clippers would have lost today. Because the Clippers were four points behind in the first half. In the second half, the Clippers sounded the counter-attack horn, and it was Rowe and Harrel who helped the Clippers get 43 points in a single quarter to blow the game in an instant.
Among them, Luwe's score and series, Harrel's bread in the basket, but the key to the Clipper's ability to turn the table. But the Australian team was really strong, and it started off against the Clippers physically.
And Melbourne united with tacit understanding, but the Clippers are too strong. The Clippers won, but Old Rivers couldn't be happy. The reason is that the injury wave is coming, and today the Clippers have three more players injured.

According to Andrew Greif, a reporter with the Clippers, Old Rivers revealed a message after the race. Beverly + Shamet + Amir were all injured, Beverly was a calf strain. Shamet suffered from wrist soreness and minor injuries. And Amir sprained his ankle.
Although it wasn't a serious injury, Old Rivers was still making a decision to give the team a day off tomorrow in order to be cautious. I hope this day will bring the whole crew back to health. The Clippers can't afford to be injured now.
In addition to the above three, Paul George and Rodney were also told that they would miss the next preseason, including the closing game, because of injuries.

At 10:30 a.m. on October 18, Beijing time, the Clippers will finish the game at home against the lone ranger. Old rivers will have to look at the injury of specific personnel and decide who to send.
But George Rodney must not be able to take part in the closing battle. It is worth mentioning that Meiji reported before. George may not only miss the preseason, he may miss 10 regular season games.
For Leonard, the Clipper now has to rely on him, and Old Rivers had previously stated that Leonard would not take turns like he did in the Raptors.

Leonard doesn't need to take a break in the new season. His physical condition is very satisfactory to the clipper. The good thing is that George is not here. But the Clippers are not weak, Leonard + Beverly's combination can support the first defense, coupled with Zubatz's growth, and Harrel and Luwe's combination can also share the pressure for the small card on the bench.
The Clippers were able to play six games against the Warriors last season, and their goal in the new season is to win the championship. In order to achieve the championship, the first thing the Clippers need to do is to protect their health.
George's shoulder injury is heartbreaking. In fact, last season, the Thunder pioneer, George was wearing shoulder injury.

Beverly himself is not an iron man. Beverly is a double-edged sword for the Clippers. Because Beverly defends fiercely but is also vulnerable to injury, the Clippers use Beverly very handy, but if injured, it is a bit difficult to row. Beverly was traded by a team to the Clippers for two seasons and played only 11 games in his first season.
Beverly's attendance reached its peak last season, with 78 regular-season games and a full playoff season. But it can't be said that Beverly got rid of injury, because in the past five years Beverly's regular season attendance has averaged over 50%.
