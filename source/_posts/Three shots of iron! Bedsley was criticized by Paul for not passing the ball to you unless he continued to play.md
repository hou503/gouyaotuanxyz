Chris Paul's performance was amazing in the Thunder's pre-season victory over New Zealand's saboteurs. But it's not the data, it's the spirit he sacrificed for the team. Because Paul only made four shots in the game and got six points, three rebounds and four assists.
Although the data is not very gorgeous, Paul is undoubtedly the temptation to score for the Thunder. Paul was suppressed by a team last season. After arriving at the Thunder, many fans also hope that Paul can increase the number of shots, at least in the face of the Thunder is Paul as the team leader.
He could do it as many times as he wanted, but Paul became a traditional point guard and a mentor of the team.

Paul is responsible for linking up the team, not fighting for the right of young players. And tactically, Paul prefers to put himself in the position of team mentor. So Thunder played real team basketball, Adams opened two pairs of models. Alexander, the future cornerstone, also cut 19 points.
Diallo also got the ball, scoring 16 points. It can be said that Paul acted to show that he could be seamlessly traded to Thunder. He did not delay the development of young people, he did not rob Alexander of the ball.
No matter which team you go to, you can help your team get into the playoffs in your own way. Because Paul is activating his teammates and making them stronger.

This is Paul's own superstar influence and what Thunder wants to see. Some stars have gorgeous statistics but can't lead the team into the playoffs, and Paul can. And when it comes to saboteurs, Paul is like a real leader. When the Thunder was 32 points ahead, Paul was still pulling rookie Darius Bedsley to guide him.
Paul stood behind Bedsley on the sidelines and gave him some guidance. Paul also revealed what he said to Bedsley today.
Paul mainly showed him some experience of the course, such as how to get vacancies and set up cover, and showed him the importance of angle.

In addition, Bedsley was warned by Paul that there was a round in which Paul communicated with Bedsley. The main reason is that Bedsley gave up a three-point shot on the fourth time after losing all three of his three-point shots.
Paul was very dissatisfied with that. He told Bedsley that if you don't have the confidence to shoot three points, then I can tell you that I won't pass you any more.
Paul said: " I told Bedsley that I think you can put it in. If I think you don't have confidence in shooting, I won't pass the ball to you!

After hearing this, Besley's eyes are no longer confused but full of self-confidence, because the boss will pay attention to you on the court. And he doesn't care if you can shoot, or if you can hit. Paul just wants these players not to hesitate when they start.
This is Paul's own alternative way of leading the team. He always gives you encouragement and support. Most of Alexander was very convinced of Paul, and today he talks about breaking the bad guys.
Alexander also apologized publicly: "I like Chris Paul's leadership, but I don't like the way I started. I was a bit slow and rash to break the bad guys in the first half!

As Van Gundy, the Pre-Magic coach, said on the show, the Thunder is still effective. Van Gundy believes that if the Thunder players are healthy, their lineup is not weak at all. They have Paul + Alexander + Adams + Robertson + Gallinari starting five tigers, backup and Schroeder, in the West can fight.
