The growth path of NBA superstars is unique. Every superstar rises in a variety of ways. Some stars are the focus of attention from the beginning. Some stars just entered the league are still unknown, even struggling, but ultimately they are the top of the basketball palace.
The starting point of the superstar road is their first official game in the league, which is the first show. For the team, the first show is the first formal assessment for the players. No matter how well these players have performed in overseas leagues, NCAA or high school leagues before, the first time they can show the highest level in the NBA level confrontation, in order to truly meet the needs of the team.
From the player's point of view, the first show is like the first assessment of their basketball career. Sometimes, the results of this assessment can directly affect their whole career process.

​
Not all the players who grew up to be League superstars made their debuts smooth or even killed all sides. For example, Kobe Bryant, the best scoring guard of the 21st century so far, had some "awkward" debuts.
Kobe's debut date was November 3, 1996. In fact, it was inside the Lakers. He was also interested in the 18-year-old high school player. The team used Divac, who was already a famous center in the league.

​
But Kobe Bryant's debut was only a six-minute substitute, with 0-point, 1-point, 1-cap and 1-fault. At that time, the Lakers'backbone was O'Neill, who wildly chopped 35+19+3-aid and 3-cap to win.
Young Kobe Bryant has been on the bench for the first two seasons, but even O'Neill, who scored 35 points in Bryant's first show, did not expect that this young man could really grow into a top player in the league, even the official rise of Kobe Bryant, so that the Lakers really have the strength to hit the third consecutive championship.
As for Kobe's brilliant and brilliant career since then, at least from the poor performance of his first show, it is entirely unrecognizable.
When James grew up to be one of the top players in the league, especially in 2009, the world regretted missing out on James and Kobe Bryant's peak rivalry, but the beginning of their careers was totally different.

​
Although Kobe Bryant is also a gifted high school student, at that time in 1996, the high school player was only an attempt of the NBA. By 2003, James, who is also a gifted high school student, had become the focus of attention of the whole American basketball circle.
The chosen one tattoo is still on James's back. He was indeed a great sensation in the United States. Even before entering the NBA, he was awarded a seven-year, $90 million high-priced contract from Nike.
The first show of "Son of Nature" did not disappoint all the people who thought about it. On October 29, 2003, LeBron James started the game, playing 42 minutes, shooting 12 of 20 shots, scoring 25 points, 6 rebounds, 9 assists and 4 steals. It was amazing.

​
James, who averaged 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists in the rookie season, became the third player in NBA history to cut 20+5+5 in the rookie season. The first two players were Big O Robertson and Michael Jordan.
James's debut figures are arguably strong enough, but looking at the history of the NBA, people will certainly focus on one person, "basketball emperor" Wilt Chamberlain.

​
Chamberlain's NBA debut against the Knicks, in the first game of the league, he hit 43 points and 28 rebounds. The stealing and blocking data at that time had not been counted, otherwise the data might be more exaggerated.

​
Chamberlain's rookie season averaged 37.6 points and 27 rebounds, including the best rookie, All-Star MVP and regular season MVP, which all sounded unreal, but it is also the best embodiment of his ability to surpass the times.
