The legendary experience of Michael Jordan's career, there are many things to be elaborated on, there is an old saying called, using data to blow Michael Jordan, may be the least innovative blow.
But in fact, Jordan's data are too shocking. He spent only five years in his career, including rookie season and two retirement seasons, and completely conquered the whole NBA, even the whole basketball world. The impact of his existence on people is inconceivable.
Average 40 +? Six to the Finals and six to win the championship? Jordan never grabs seven? Three consecutive crowns? Three more consecutive titles after retirement? Five MVPs? 72-10, the first win in history? It's shocking enough to throw out a single data, but Jordan never lacks such shocks.
However, as far as scoring is concerned, the reason why Jordan can be called the best player in NBA history lies in his absolute dominance over scoring.

​
Jordan ranked first in the regular season history and first in the playoffs history. Jordan also ranked first in the playoffs history. In Michael Jordan's 15-year career, Jordan has won 10 Championship trophies.
Today's stars, who are very capable of scoring, are already quite good at winning one scoring champion in their career. Those who have won more than two scoring champions are enough to call them scorers of historical rank. In the era of the same talents in the 1980s and 1990s, Jordan ruled the award and from 1987 to 1993. Jordan scored seven consecutive points, appalling.
It is reasonable to say that there are talented people in Jiangshan Dynasty, each leading the way for hundreds of years, but in front of the powerful Jordan, all the top scorers seem to have to come second.
This point, we do not get from Jordan scoring king to analyze, after all, this is nothing new, why we from Jordan lost the remaining five scoring champions in 15 years, more highlight his horror.

​
In the last two years of Jordan's career, he averaged 22.9 points per game and 20 points per game, which is far from the average level of his career. But in the last two years, Jordan was nearly 40 years old, and even such Jordan scored 51 points per game.

​
But even Jordan can not withstand the impact of years. In those two seasons, Iverson scored 31.4 points per game in 2001-2002 and McGrady scored 32.1 points per game in 2002-2003. In the 2001-2002 season, Jordan still ranked ninth in the league in average points per game.

​
Jordan's rookie season also failed to win the scoring championship, but just entering the first year of the league, Jordan has scored an average of 28.2 points, 6.2 rebounds and 5.3 assists in 82 games, ranking third in the scoring list. This is only Jordan of the rookie season, who scored 32.9 points per game by Bernard King. Win.
Jordan failed to win the scoring in the second season of his career, but only 3 games were played at the beginning of the season. Jordan suffered a left foot fracture and was not returned to the court until the end of the season. The scoring king of the season was picked up by Dominic Wilkins. "The essence of human movie" is also a great shooting guard. Average 30.3 points per game in each season. But it was Jordan that season, although the playoffs were swept by the Celtics, the championship team of the season, but played a single playoff highest score of 63 points miracle.
Jordan's shocking scoring performance lasted seven seasons, starting with an average of 37.1 points per game in his third season, until his first three consecutive championships and retirement.

​
In the short season after his retirement, Jordan played only 17 games. He was in no condition and scored only 26.9 points per game. Of course, he did not win the title. That season's top scorer was O'Neill, who averaged 29.3 points per game. In fact, Jordan was scored by O'Neill's Magic team in the playoffs that year. Out of the game.

When everyone thought that Jordan's era had completely passed, Jordan, who returned to power next season, won three consecutive championships and won three consecutive scoring championships, completed the miracle of 10 scoring champions.
In Jordan's season, apart from the rookie season and the senile season, he scored all the points, which is the so-called peak dominance.
