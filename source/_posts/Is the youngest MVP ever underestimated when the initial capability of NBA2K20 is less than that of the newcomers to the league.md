If you only look at the data, how much value do you think such a player can get?
The player averaged 18 points last season, with 2.7 rebounds and 4.3 assists. What's more, his efficiency is worth mentioning. This is the data he averaged 27.3 minutes per game. In addition, his shooting percentage is the second highest in his career, 48.2%, and his three-point shooting rate is a career high of 37%, far higher than the career average of 30. 4%.

​
With an average of 27 minutes per game, 18 points have been contributed efficiently, which is the starting level or higher than the starting requirement of each team. Such a point guard is acceptable to any team, but such a player, such Derek Ross, has only scored 80 points out of the 2K20 published ability value.
Meanwhile, this year's top rookie Zion scored 81 on the 2K20, surpassing Derek Ross.

​
Last season's rookie season, Terry Yang, who performed well, has risen from 77 in 2K19 to 85. Last season, although Terry Yang averaged 19.1 points per game and had 8.1 assists, his shooting percentage was only 41.8%. This is certainly acceptable for a rookie who entered the NBA in his first year, but averaged 19.1 points per game. Scores are still accumulated through 15.5 shots per game.
In contrast, Rose averaged 14.8 shots per game, but the shooting rate was significantly better, that is, in the three-point point, Rose's 37% shooting rate was also better than Trey-Young's 32.4%. ​

​
Of course, for Ross, it may be more official to take age and physical condition into account, but the ability value of 80 is still too disrespectful for the youngest MVP of the former NBA.
Compared with Trey Yang, it is not necessarily to highlight Rosebury Yang Qiang. What Trey Yang's rookie season shows is surprising enough. Especially his passing skills have definitely met the requirements of NBA level.
But the ability value of Trey-Yang 85 is not too difficult for Ross, who is more efficient, to get 82 to 83, even if it is not equal to that of Trey-Yang.

On this point, in fact, look at Lillard's view on the ranking of players'ability value.
In an interview with The Athletic, Lillard talked about the player's ability. His own ability in the 2K20 is 92, ranking ninth in the NBA.
"No problem. I never really cared. I don't understand why players get angry about their 2K abilities. I mean, many of the people involved in developing this game may not even shoot.

​
In fact, Lillard's evaluation is reasonable. Developing games takes into account the content of the NBA, but more from the perspective of a game, it is foolish to let such developers characterize NBA players and use so-called ability values to delimit the boundaries of an NBA-level player.
The NBA players are the ones who don't need to worry or worry about it, but on the contrary, because most of the players in the League love this game, they naturally care about their ability value, which brings a wave.

However, among these players, Derek Ross, who once shocked the league, is now a sensual star who has broken cocoons into butterflies for the second time. Derek Ross, who once inspired and touched millions of people, is probably the most unaffected by these trends at present. Member.
Ross did everything he could in the Timberwolves last season. The leader of the dressing room, the commander on the court, could take over the game at the critical moment. He also played a highly efficient game, which was rare in his career, to get out of the shadow of injury.

The post-match interview that scored 50 points turned out to be one of the few touching scenes of last season. Ross, who was reborn from bathing, came to the automobile city in summer, came to the piston and the twin towers. Their collocation made Ross more expectant in the new season.
The sun will rise again tomorrow, and the rose will bloom again.
Tomorrow the sun is still shining, and the roses will blossom again.
