​
This year's finals, the Warriors against the Raptors G3, the Warriors Clay because of injuries and sickness arranged by the team rest, has been absent Major General Warriors face such a dilemma, can only hope in their core, Curie can make a big difference.
In that game, Curie was obviously different from his usual way of playing in recent years. The Warriors'offensive space has become worse and worse in recent seasons. Starting in a Gothic team, the three-point dream has declined, and cousin's condition is unstable. Under the premise, the Warriors have only one strong offensive point, Stephen Curie.

​
Curie certainly did not live up to expectations. He did his best to help the team throughout the game, and finally scored 47 points, which was his highest point in the playoffs, but it was still not enough to help the team win.
Of course, this is also the first 40 + in five Finals of Curie's career. In the age of small balls with such an open attack rhythm, Curie, whose three-point attack is the representative way, has only got one 40 + in the Finals, which is difficult to imagine.

In fact, throughout the history of the NBA, since the free statistics, the Finals 40 + only appeared 58 times.
We all know that Kobe Bryant is a famous super scorer in history, but in seven finals of his career, Kobe Bryant only got 40 +, equal to Stephen Cooley.
Kobe Bryant made seven finals and five championships in his career, but he only scored 40 points in the G1 against Magic in the 2009 Finals, which was the only 40 + in his career.

​
In that game, Kobe Bryant scored 16 of 34 shots, 8 free throws, 8 free throws, 40 shots, and 8 rebounds, 8 assists, 2 blocked shots. The high score and other data are quite comprehensive in Kobe Bryant, which usually means that the Lakers will win a big victory.
The Lakers eventually scored a 100-75 victory over Magic, and the Lakers won the championship 4-1.
It's not disgraceful that there is only one 40 + in the finals, and many great gods in history have only one, such as Iverson, Durant, Julius Owen, Barkley, Jabbar and even Chamberlain, the basketball emperor.
More than two players have many horror records, such as Elgin Baylor, who has 40 + points in four finals, and keeps a record of 61 points in a single finals game.
For example, Rick Barry, who scored 40 + three times in the finals, was the first one in the history of the finals.
For example, O'Neill, who won five 40 + finals, and O'Neill, who won five 40 + finals in three consecutive championships, had a strong dominance.

​
For example, Michael Jordan, who won 40 + points six times in the Finals, has an average score of 40 + in the single-round Finals. Nobody can break the record so far. It is even more desirable to win 6 Championships and FMVP in the Finals.
LeBron James, a terror figure who has made eight consecutive finals, has more 40 + times than Jordan in the finals, seven times altogether. Coincidentally, these seven times all appeared in the finals of the opposing warriors.

But such James can only be ranked second, the first in the history of this data, is the Finals 10 times 40 + Jerry West, NBA LOGO men.
History is 58 times, he alone accounted for 10 times, this proportion is terrible, but LOGO man is most praised for his defeat FMVP, the only history, during the finals, his scores were 53 points, 41 points, 24 points, 39 points, 26 points, 42 points, and grabbed 7 points, 42 points, 13 baskets and 12 assists super triple double.
