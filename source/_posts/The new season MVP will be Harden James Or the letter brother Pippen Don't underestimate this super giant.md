The NBA's new season, 2019-20 season, from the current point of view, the level of excitement can be really low, there is a newly formed super battleship Los Angeles Clippers, there are also Lakers trying to revitalize the Zijin giants, the western jazz, the eastern 76ers It’s recruiting, and there’s a bit of contending between the East and the West. Of course, from the odds or the lineup, the Clippers are the most promising team to win the championship, but at least the chances of each team have already It has become a lot bigger than before.
So, not only is the title of the championship, but the ownership of the MVP will become quite interesting. Can James stay healthy in the new season? If the Clippers get the first record of the league, how to choose? Perhaps it is Joachim who is still making progress? Or is it still Harden who still has super scoring ability? The letter of the couple's couplet?
However, today, when the bull named Pippen was invited to the famous basketball talk show "The Jump" in the United States, he gave different opinions.
Pippen mentioned the new season's Warriors, and the new season's Stephen Curry.

"The Warriors have built a culture of winning. Stephen is one of the most difficult defenders in the league." Pippen said, "I can't find him the reason why MVP is the hottest. One thing is that he will be the ball." The team's only focus, in the past few years, his shooting ability has converged because of the arrival of KD, I think he will return to the level before KD arrived."
In fact, Pippen’s remarks are very interesting. It’s not that he is optimistic about the facts in Curry. In the odds of MVP, Curry is also the top three in the high game. Considering the top teams in the West, James and Chou , George and Leonard match, Wei Shao and Harden match, the superstar's match will always make them not much advantage in the MVP competition, so if the Warriors get a good record, Curry won the MVP The odds are still relatively large.
But the interesting point is not here. In fact, as early as 2016, Pippen three years ago, the attitude towards Curry is far from this.

Curry was born in the past to win the championship and MVP. In the second year, he won an unprecedented all-time MVP, but Pippen did not seem to recognize Curry's all-inclusive MVP. He said in an interview in the same year: In those days, we were two three consecutive championships, and the Warriors, they were still tender, Curry has not reached the point worthy of my worship, do not think he can get a full vote. This is what Jordan does not have."
In 2017, Durant came to the Warriors, and Pippen still did not have much respect for Curry.
"Stephen (Curry) is a good player, but not dominant. Yes, he has won two MVPs, but he is not the best player in the Finals, nor the best player in the Warriors."
"Maybe he is very good, a great player," Pippen continued. "But he doesn't have dominance."

Then, Curry led the Warriors to the finals five times and won three championships. Curry’s personal level has become more stable and powerful on the stage of the playoffs. Beginning in 18 years, Pippen’s evaluation of Curry has begun to change.
"His (Curry) sacrifice for KD is one of the greatest stories in basketball history." "History has never seen a player like him who forced his opponent to expand to such a degree." One after another, Pippen’s disdain and contempt for Curry has now turned into respect and recognition. Even Curry’s personal sacrifice has made Pippen admire Curry’s personality.

When we were accustomed to the behavior of the famous people, the change of Pippen was a very rare thing.
