James played 11 minutes in the fourth quarter of the game. He got 5 points, 2 rebounds and 3 assists in 6-for-1 shots. Several times he wanted to hammer the set tone through the three-point shot. But in this quarter, all the three-point shots were shot. In the whole game, he shot 6-for-0 shots, and only 10-for-5 free throws. It can be said that although James got three doubles today, he would not be black or spurted, but if James's regular water was used Ping to measure, in fact, playing is not very good, if no one else to stand up, all rely on him, then the Lakers game will be reversed, kneeling.
Bushmei played 7 minutes in the fourth quarter, 3-for-1, 4 points and 2 rebounds. From the perspective of the Lakers' tactics, the key moment is usually the rotation singles between James and bushmei. In the last game against lone ranger, in the extra time game, the Lakers broke dongqiqi through the "Errenzhuan" between James and bushmei. But this game is not so simple. The final effect is not obvious, because as long as the thick eyebrow turns inside, it will be caught. The ability of the thick eyebrow to get out of the ball is not as top-level as James. It will be caught in a narrow range, and there is a great chance of mistakes.

Fortunately, the Lakers have thighs. Howard doesn't mean that he came out and became the Savior. He just plays as usual. Don't say that he has a high enthusiasm in this game. This is a wrong statement, because he has such a high enthusiasm in every game. He is trying to protect the rebounds in every game. He is trying to do a good job in the defense of the interior line and his own staff At the same time, when we rotate the ball on the court, we even give the ball to pop, Bradley and others to direct how to rotate the ball. After all, it's a player full of honors. After all, it's a player who has played in the finals. Howard has more experience than most of the Lakers.
Howard played 12 minutes in the last quarter, 5-for-5, got 10 points, 6 rebounds, 2 blocks, plus or minus 2. Although he only helped the Lakers win 2 points, but without Howard, if Howard was replaced by McGrady or Kuzma, the Lakers would not only win 2 points, maybe lose 20 points, because both James and bushbrow are dumb. Is it up to McGrady and Kuzma Is ZMA aggressive at both ends of attack and defense?

Let's sort out what Howard did in the last 12 minutes to help the Lakers.
In 11 minutes and 45 seconds, the Spurs played in the first round, and mills and center borrtel played the pick and roll. When the defense changed to Howard, Howard got a big hand. Mills didn't dare to step inside, but wanted to pass the ball back to bolt. But Howard obviously blocked Mills's vision, and the ball directly reached James. Yes, James "picked up" a snatch.
In 9:50, Howard and pop play the pick and roll. Pop doesn't have a chance. The ball comes to Caruso's hand. With 10 seconds left, Caruso passes the ball to Howard at the low post. This is the first time for Howard in this game. It's also one of the few calls for the ball this season. With his back to borrtel, Howard turns around and puts the ball in easily, helping the Lakers to stabilize the 7 points. Advantages.
Nine minutes and 20 seconds, Howard faced Mills's breakthrough. With a big hand, mills was confused. The ball went out and the Spurs made a mistake.
In 7:50, Howard and Bradley hit the pick and roll. The latter held the ball and went inside. The former went down quickly, and the two finished an air relay. James took gailla out, and the Spurs left the inside to block Bradley's bolt.

In 6:58, Howard and Bradley played the pick and roll. This time, bolt sealed it. Although Bradley didn't make the shot, Howard grabbed the rebounds in the front court and finished the dunk. There are four people in the Spurs' internal line, and no one can stop Howard, who is already in a good position.
In 5:30, James didn't play against Aldridge's defense. He stopped the ball outside the three-point line. Howard wanted to make an answer himself, but he received James's pass from the deep inside of the penalty area. He saw bolt in front of him. He swayed for a while, played the ball up to 2 + 1, and extended the difference to 4 points. The free throw didn't go in, but he grabbed the front rebounds. Later, James did not give the ball to drozan's thick eyebrow defense, but in front of their own singles defender - or bolt! A foul was committed.
Three minutes and 48 seconds, the two sides tied, pop didn't score three points, standing under the basket four Spurs players are ready to receive rebounds, when all the Lakers players are retreating, Howard is still fighting in place, the Spurs hit the ball out of the bottom line this time, it's Howard's credit, help the Lakers win more ball rights, pop hit the mid shot.

2:50, James missed the shot, Howard from the free throw line to the front rebounds to make up the ball. In 1:50, Howard slammed Murray's layup, and James got the ball and hit back for a foul. In 1:05, guy took the ball to fight back, Howard retreated to the border, took out the ball with a big hand, guy knocked the ball out of the baseline, Lakers ball right. So far, the Spurs are gone, and the Lakers are in control.
In the last 12 minutes, almost every round is the key ball. Howard has made great contributions in the above nine rounds, either scoring, defending successfully, or winning the ball for the Lakers. Howard's top defensive ability and a dedicated defensive attitude are the most fundamental reasons for the Lakers to win the game.

The whole game was played for 20 minutes, the first game didn't let go, the first three games played for 8 minutes, the last game was ordered to play for 12 minutes, which is the same as the last game, and the effect of Howard is also very similar, because Howard changed the defense of the Lakers, so the game changed.
Howard is the only man in the Lakers who can decide the game without scoring!
