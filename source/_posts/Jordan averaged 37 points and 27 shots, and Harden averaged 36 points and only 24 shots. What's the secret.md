​
The definition of super scorer is closely related to the score in words. You can't say that a scorer can't even achieve 25 points per game. And super scorer can't say that without a season of 30 + per game.
In fact, there are only 33 players who can break 30 points per season in the whole history of the NBA. In the past 70 years, only 30 pairs of talented people have been found. If we count the data after the amalgamation of the NBA and ABA in 1976, only 18 players have averaged 30 +.
Put the upper limit a little higher. In NBA history, players with an average score of more than 35 points per game are also the top figures standing on the spire in the star-studded pyramid. Only six superstars have appeared in 70 years'history. After the combination of NBA and ABA, Michael Jordan is the only one. Kobe Bryant and James Harden for the 2018-19 season last season.

​
The high score necessarily represents the centralized ball power and the super-high shot, but the high score does not necessarily represent the high score, also has the efficiency is not too good player, under the super-high hand accumulation still failed to hit the amazing score, this is precisely 1976 until now only three big gods completed the season average 35 + difficult. Place.
Michael Jordan in 1986-87 was his second full season. After all, at the beginning of the 85-86 season, he suffered a serious injury to his left scaphoid bone and missed 64 games without breath. He did not return until the playoffs, even though Jordan had 63 points in the playoffs that year when God put on Jordan's 23 jersey. Miracles are also the single-game scoring record of the NBA playoffs, but in the playoffs they were simply swept out by the 3-0 down by the Celtics, the championship team of that year.

​
In the second full season of Jordan's career, the rookie season has been upgraded again by Jordan, who averaged 28 points per game, with a season average of 37.1 points after the 1976 NBA and ABA merger.
In the 86-87 season, Jordan averaged 37.1 points per game, 5.2 rebounds and 4.6 assists, 2.9 steals per game and 1.5 blocks per game. Like Kobe's performance in the 2005-06 season, his personal heroism was almost at its peak.
That season, Jordan scored an average of 37.1 points, used 27.8 shots per game, appalling, but in fact, Jordan's shooting rate of 48.2% is quite good.

​
27.8 shots, or average shots, Jordan's shots were terrible enough, but he played 82 games throughout the season, averaging 40 minutes per game. This kind of physical explosion scoring performance is really shocking.
In the 2005-06 season, Bryant's scoring performance was not so good. In fact, the Lakers had a good record of 45-35 in that season. At the beginning of the season, Bryant tried to sacrifice his ball rights for the team, but after seeing the team did not improve, he started to maintain the scoring feast for the whole season regardless.

​
The modern basketball miracle of 81 points in a single game also appeared in that season. In January and April of two months, Bryant scored more than 40 points in a monthly average, with six 50 + points in a single season. Bryant's explosive scoring performances still make people fascinated and deeply affect a generation.

​
Bryant averaged 35.4 points per game in the 2005-06 season, using 27.2 shots per game. At that time, the Lakers had no other people to rely on.
But when it comes to the ratio of scoring to shooting, Harden should miss the winning smile, because in today's basketball trend, Harden seems to perform better.
Last season, Harden also played a great season, averaging 36.1 points per game, the only time Jordan has surpassed Kobe Bryant since 1976, and this time he averaged 36.1 points, only used 24.5 shots, which is the most exaggerated place.

​
It may be questioned whether Harden's free throw ability has taken advantage of him, but it is not true. Harden averaged 11 free throws per game last season, which is the highest in his career, but is not as good as Jordan's 11.9 free throws in the 86-87 season, and Kobe's 10.2 free throws.
In fact, it was his three-point shooting and three-point ratio that really broke out Harden's score. Harden's average three-point shooting number was 13.2 times last season. With so many shots, Harden still stabilized his three-point shooting rate to 36.8%, which is a terrible efficiency.

​
In any case, three points are one point more than two points, and children can calculate math problems. When three points remain high while still being able to keep high hits, the speed of the score increase is naturally unimaginable, which also gave birth to the great season of Harden.
