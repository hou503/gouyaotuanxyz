It has been more than 70 years since the establishment of the NBA in New York in 1946. During these 70 years, the NBA has produced too many talented people.
Because of the previous position differentiation of the NBA, players in all positions should have their own responsibilities. Only by doing their own work can the whole team become strong.
But in fact, the talent gap is that some players can achieve 2-3 positions, or even 5 positions can be proficient, this type of player is also the pronoun of NBA omnipotence.

In today's league, the most versatile player must be LeBron James, who can maintain a career average of 27 + 7 + 7. James can play the role of point guard. He also plays the role of main point guard most of his career. Perhaps only the specific position of point guard is James. Weak, but his scoring ability is still outstanding. The most needed breakthrough ability in the position of small forward is LeBron's strongest aspect. The position of big forward and center, James has many top positions in the small lineup, even if not so perfect, but with his size can not drag back legs.

​
In our broad sense, omnipotence means omnipotence on the court, scoring and tandem defense. In this respect, James, who has been selected five times to defend one batch, has been in the forefront of the League for years with high scoring efficiency and assists.
But that's James. His data on the blocked cap is just average.
Blocks are more dominated by the interior, while steals are more dominated by guards. James's total number of blockades in his career is 921, and his current ranking is still outside the top 100 in history.
With such a player, his five main data points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocked caps are ranked in the top 50 in history, which is not a super versatile player? This player is Kevin Garnett, Wolf King.

In fact, Garnett's omnipotence has long been circulated in the league. In 2000-2005, Garnett averaged at least 21 points, 11 rebounds and 5 assists in six consecutive seasons, keeping this super data for six seasons, and still as an interior line, which makes people lament Garnett's omnipotence. At that time, it was quite rare for center power forward to average 5 assists per season, let alone maintain the same level for six consecutive seasons.

Garnett is also a good offensive and defensive player. His backward jumper seems to be a different kind of big forward. His rebounding ability is particularly prominent because of his long arm. His assisting ability has a lot to do with the ball he has trained since childhood. His blocking ability is his guardian ability. In fact, stealing is his defense. Area fits, his defensive area covers almost the entire half-court, and his flexible movement speed gives him such ability.

​
Garnett's total career score is 26071, ranking 17th in history, 14662 career rebounds, ranking 9th in history, 5445 career assists. This figure can rank 49th in history, 1859 career steals, 18th in history, career blocks. The total number is 2037, ranking 18th in history.

​
These five main data are located in the top 50 of history, which is the only one in the history of the NBA more than 70 years ago. Four of them are still in the top 20. Garnett is known as one of the most versatile power forward in history, which is not necessarily an empty breeze.
